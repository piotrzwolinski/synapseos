SYNAPSEOS — WHAT THE TOOL CAN DO TODAY
=======================================


PRODUCT FAMILIES SUPPORTED
--------------------------
  - GDB   Standard filter housing (bag/pocket/compact filters)
  - GDC   Carbon filter housing (cartridge, bayonet mount)
  - GDC FLEX   Carbon housing with extractable rail
  - GDMI  Insulated filter housing (double-walled modules)
  - GDP   Panel filter housing (flat/pleat pre-filters)
  - PFF   Panel filter frame


ENVIRONMENTS RECOGNIZED
-----------------------
  - Hospital / Healthcare
  - Commercial Kitchen
  - ATEX Zone
  - Marine / Offshore
  - Pharmaceutical / Cleanroom
  - Outdoor / Rooftop
  - Wastewater Treatment
  - Swimming Pool
  - Flour Mill / Grain Processing
  - Paint Shop
  - Powder Coating Line


MATERIALS & CORROSION CLASSES
-----------------------------
  - FZ — Galvanized (C3)
  - AZ — Aluzink (C4)
  - ZM — Zinc-Magnesium (C5)
  - RF — Stainless Steel (C5)
  - SF — Acid-proof (C5.1)

  Automatic enforcement: environment determines minimum corrosion class.
  Chlorine threshold logic selects RF vs SF based on ppm concentration.


EXPERT REASONING MODULES (11)
------------------------------

1. Product Selection
   Recommends the optimal product family based on application context,
   environmental hazards, and required physical traits. Covers all 6
   product families with trait-based scoring.

2. Environment Assessment
   Automatic identification of environmental hazards (grease, chlorine,
   humidity, explosive atmosphere, etc.) and their impact on product
   selection. 11 environments modeled with causal stressor chains.

3. Material Specification
   Selects and validates housing material based on detected environment,
   chlorine thresholds, and corrosion class requirements. Blocks
   unsuitable materials with explanation and alternatives.

4. Sizing & Arrangement
   Module selection and quantity calculation based on airflow. Handles
   explicit dimensions (dimension lock), spatial constraints (max
   width/height), and arrangement geometry (horizontal x vertical).

5. Multi-Stage Assembly
   When a stressor neutralizes a product's primary trait (e.g. grease
   blocks carbon pores), the system automatically designs a 2-stage
   assembly with a protector housing upstream. Dimensions and airflow
   sync across stages.

6. Installation Feasibility
   Three constraint types validate physical fit: computed clearance
   formulas, environment-to-material whitelists, and chemical threshold
   checks. Blocks with explanation when constraints are violated.

7. Compliance & Safety Gates
   Logic gates collect additional parameters before safety-critical
   decisions: chlorine concentration, ATEX zone classification, dew
   point conditions, grease loading confirmation.

8. Accessories & Transitions
   Compatibility validation for locks (EXL), mounting systems (Polis),
   duct transitions (TT conical, PT flat), flanges, and door configs.
   33 transition piece sizes mapped by housing size to duct diameter.
   12 filter consumables matched by product variant.

9. Product Code & Weight
   Generates complete orderable product codes from graph templates.
   Weight lookup from variant data or parametric models. Multi-module
   weight aggregation for structural calculations.

10. Alternative Recommendations
    When primary selection is blocked, finds verified alternatives:
    material swaps (same product, different material) or product family
    changes. Space and capacity alternatives included.

11. Multi-Turn Consultation
    Full session memory persisted in the Knowledge Graph. Parameters,
    material locks, and assembly groups survive across turns — including
    after days of inactivity. Bare number answers route correctly to
    pending clarifications.
