The system will be exposed to Chemical Vapor Exposure, Outdoor Condensation, Grease/Oil Exposure, Salt Spray, and Hygiene Requirements.To address these, we've designed a two-stage filtration system. The first stage uses a GDP Planfilterskåp to remove grease and particulate, protecting the second stage GDC_FLEX filter from fouling. Grease/Oil Exposure is a critical concern because lipids can irreversibly coat the activated carbon pores, reducing its effectiveness. Therefore, mechanical pre-filtration is mandatory.Unfortunately, the GDC_FLEX family is not suitable for this application due to the risk of Outdoor Condensation. Condensation forms on non-insulated metal surfaces, so a double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point. Additionally, the marine climate with Salt Spray requires C5-M marine-grade corrosion resistance.To finalize the configuration, I need a few more details:Additionally, the requested 3000 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 1200x600 mm module can handle 3500 m³/h.",
