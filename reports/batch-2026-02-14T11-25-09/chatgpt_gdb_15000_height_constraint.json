However, the height constraint is ≤1500mm, and 900mm height satisfies this. The problem is that GDB 900×1800 (width=900, height=1800) would NOT work, but 1800×900 (width=1800, height=900) does. Yet there are smaller options like 1500×1800 (height=1800, exceeds limit) or 900×1800 (height=1800, exceeds). Actually 1800×900 works. But the system fails to mention that this is not the only option — GDB 1200×1500 at 17,000 m³/h (height=1500, exactly at limit) or 1500×1200 at 17,000 m³/h (height=1200) could also work. More critically, the PDF shows GDB 1800×900 has 15,300 m³/h capacity, not exactly 15,000 — the system claims it 'accommodates 15,000 m³/h' which is acceptable since 15,300 ≥ 15,000.

However, the system doesn't state the actual capacity (15,300) and there's no verification the system correctly identified this — it just says 'accommodate 15,000 m³/h' without citing the actual value. Additionally, the PDF shows GDB 1800×900 weight as 77 kg (750/800) or 36 kg (550/600) — the 550/600 weight of 36 kg seems anomalously low compared to other entries, suggesting a possible PDF typo, but the system doesn't address weight at all.",

The PDF shows 1800×900 weight as 77 kg for 750/800 and 36 kg for 550/600. The system quotes ~77.0 kg which matches the 750/800 column.

The airflow of 15,300 m³/h exceeds the requested 15,000 m³/h which is acceptable but the system didn't note this is slightly over-spec. The weight listed in PDF page 9 for 1800x900 at 750/800 is actually 77 kg for the 750/800 column — but wait, the PDF shows 'Vikt kg 750/800' = 77 and 'Vikt kg 550/600' = 36, so 77 kg is correct for 750mm length. One issue: the PDF actually shows the weight as 77 for 1800x900 at 550/600 is 36, which seems odd — re-reading, the 1800x900 row shows 77 | 36 which means 750/800=77 kg, 550/600=36 kg.
