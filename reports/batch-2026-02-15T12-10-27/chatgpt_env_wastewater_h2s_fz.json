Hydrogen sulfide aggressively attacks zinc coatings, leading to rapid corrosion of FZ (C3 galvanized) materials.Additionally, gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption, but mechanical filters like the GDB cannot capture gas-phase contaminants.The product is also not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation, as its bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER, constructed to meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment, and made of a material resistant to H2S corrosion. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
