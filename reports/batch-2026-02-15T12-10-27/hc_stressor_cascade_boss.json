      "content": "For the rooftop kitchen exhaust at the hospital, several environmental factors must be considered. The system will be exposed to High Humidity, Chemical Vapor Exposure, Outdoor Condensation, Grease/Oil Exposure, Salt Spray, and Hygiene Requirements.The GDC_FLEX filter you requested is not suitable for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements. Additionally, the non-insulated housing will cause condensation, and the carbon filter is vulnerable to irreversible deactivation from Grease/Oil Exposure.To address these issues, a multi-stage filtration system is required. This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp for mechanical pre-filtration to protect against grease and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp for chemical vapor removal. The GDMI Modulfilterskåp is suitable for marine environments.The requested airflow of 3000 m³/h exceeds the capacity of a single 600x600 module, which is rated for 1750 m³/h. Therefore, the configuration requires two modules in parallel, resulting in effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm.For the GDMI filter, the requested RF (Stainless Steel) material is not available. The available materials are AZ (Aluzink) and ZM (ZinkMagnesium).To proceed, I need the filter depth for the GDMI filter.",
