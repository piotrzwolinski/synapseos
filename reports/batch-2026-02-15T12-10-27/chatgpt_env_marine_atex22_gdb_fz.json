      "content": "This configuration for your offshore application in an ATEX Zone 22 area requires careful consideration of environmental factors and safety.The GDB filter housing is not suitable for marine environments due to its bolted construction and C2 corrosion class, which do not meet the leakage and hygiene requirements for marine applications with high humidity and salt spray. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C2-rated galvanized steel (FZ), leading to premature failure. Additionally, outdoor condensation can form on the housing's surface.To address these issues, I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. This modular filter housing provides the necessary corrosion resistance and sealing for offshore applications.Given the presence of an explosive atmosphere, all components must be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. This requires grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components, anti-static filter media, and equipotential bonding between all housing sections.To provide a complete solution, I propose a two-stage filtration system: a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target stage. This assembly ensures that the GDMI is protected from the harsh marine environment, while the GDP provides pre-filtration.To finalize the configuration, I need two details: the airflow for the system and the filter depth for the GDMI stage.",
