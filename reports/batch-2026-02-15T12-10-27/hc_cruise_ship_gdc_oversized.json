      "content": "For the cruise ship exhaust application, I understand you need a filtration system capable of handling 2600 m³/h airflow. However, the GDC filter housing is not suitable for the marine environment due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray and condensation from outdoor installation. The GDC housing has a C2 corrosion class and is designed for indoor use only.The marine environment exposes the system to high humidity and salt spray, requiring C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. Outdoor installation also introduces the risk of outdoor condensation, requiring a double-wall insulated housing to maintain the surface above the dew point.Therefore, I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. To provide a complete filtration solution, I propose a two-stage assembly:To finalize the configuration:Additionally, the requested 2600 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 2000 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 3000 m³/h.",
