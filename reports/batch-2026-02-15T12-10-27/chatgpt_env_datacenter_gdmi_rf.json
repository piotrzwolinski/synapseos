Please select an available material to proceed.For the outdoor data center intake, we're configuring a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions.I need two more details to finalize the configuration. First, the GDMI housing will be exposed to high humidity and outdoor condensation. High humidity can accelerate corrosion, so the housing will be C4 corrosion class. However, stainless steel (RF) is unavailable for the GDMI product family. I recommend either Aluzink (AZ) or ZinkMagnesium (ZM) for corrosion resistance.Second, to protect against condensation, I need to evaluate the risk of condensation. For this, I need to know the minimum ambient temperature and relative humidity at the installation site.Finally, what is the required airflow capacity (m³/h)?",
