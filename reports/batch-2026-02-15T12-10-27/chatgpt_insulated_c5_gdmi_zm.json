Salt spray can accelerate zinc corrosion, and outdoor installation can cause condensation. The first stage will capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the second stage.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",
