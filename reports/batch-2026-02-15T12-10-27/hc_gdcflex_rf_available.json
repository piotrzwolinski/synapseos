      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC_FLEX filter is not suitable due to particulate and condensation risks. Particulate Exposure from the cleanroom environment requires mechanical filtration, while GDC_FLEX uses carbon adsorption which is ineffective against solid particulates. Additionally, Outdoor Condensation on the non-insulated housing can lead to corrosion. Finally, the bolted construction of the GDC_FLEX does not meet the Hygiene Requirements for pharmaceutical environments.Therefore, the GDC_FLEX is blocked for this application. Instead, I recommend a two-stage filtration system using the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for pharmaceutical environments. This system will protect against both particulate and chemical vapor exposure.This multi-stage assembly consists of a GDP Planfilterskåp (Stage 1) for mechanical filtration to capture particulates, protecting the GDMI Modulfilterskåp (Stage 2) which uses carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors. Both stages will use 600x600mm housings to match your required airflow of 1750 m³/h.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:First, what is the filter depth you need for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp (Stage 2)?Second, to mitigate the risk of Outdoor Condensation, I need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.",
