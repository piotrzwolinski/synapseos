      "content": "This GDC filter housing configuration is for air recirculation in a swimming pool environment. This application exposes the system to both High Humidity and Chlorine Exposure.The GDC housing has a C2 corrosion class. The zinc coating (C3) of the GDC dissolves in chlorinated environments within months. High humidity will also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing its service life. For chlorine environments, a minimum C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) is required.Unfortunately, this configuration is blocked. The selected FZ material is not rated for ENV_POOL installation and tolerates a maximum of 0ppm chlorine, but the environment has approximately 200ppm. The bolted construction of this product does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for a pool environment.Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need a material that tolerates at least 200ppm chlorine and is rated for ENV_POOL installation. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the multi-stage assembly, I need two details:What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?",
