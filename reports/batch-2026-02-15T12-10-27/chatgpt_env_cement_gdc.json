However, in environments with particulate exposure like a flour mill, activated carbon filters like the GDC are prone to pore blockage, which reduces their effectiveness. To address this, we need to implement a two-stage filtration system.This system will consist of a GDP Planfilterskåp as a pre-filter to capture particulate matter, followed by the GDC filter for gas and odor control. This ensures the GDC's adsorption capacity isn't compromised by the particulate exposure.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:Which ATEX zone classification applies (Zone 0/1/2 for gas, Zone 20/21/22 for dust)?",
