The presence of Chemical Vapor Exposure and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion means that the GDB filter housing in FZ (C3 galvanized) is unsuitable. H2S aggressively attacks zinc coatings, and the housing corrosion class is C2. FZ (C3 galvanized) corrodes rapidly in H2S environments. Additionally, gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption, but mechanical filters like GDB cannot capture gas-phase contaminants.The product is also not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation, as it uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER, constructed to withstand H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion, and capable of removing chemical vapors. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
