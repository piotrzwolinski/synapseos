Finally, accessory modeling (EXL, Filter Profil) should be changed from fake WxH shapes (e.g., 300xNone) to correct 1D/2D parameter models to prevent downstream code-format and selection bugs."

The material availability per family is correctly mapped, and the accessory products (PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil) are all represented.\n\nThe most significant findings are: (1) A suspected PDF error in GDB 1800x900 short weight (36 kg vs expected ~62 kg) which the graph correctly flags; (2) A known source conflict in GDMI between text-stated lengths (550/600, 800/850) and table-stated lengths (600/650, 850/900) which the graph documents; (3) A similar weight column labeling issue in GDMI FLEX where both columns appear labeled identically; (4) A potential module count error in GDB 600x900 where the graph shows ½=1 instead of ¼=1; and (5) A naming convention inconsistency in GDC FLEX where the first size '600x300' has Bredd=300 and Höjd=600, which may cause confusion.\n\nOverall, the graph scores well on completeness and accuracy. The main areas for improvement are: correcting the GDB 600x900 module count interpretation, adding explicit documentation for the GDMI FLEX weight column labeling error, and ensuring consistent width/height conventions across all product families. The graph's approach of documenting source conflicts rather than silently choosing one interpretation is commendable engineering practice."

Conversely, claims that GDMI should include FZ based on the general 'common materials' statement are not supported by the GDMI-specific page, and enumerating specific 'on request' materials for PT/TT is not verifiable because the PDF only says 'other materials on request' without listing them. After incorporating these corrections/constraints and retracting the GDP frame-depth point (which is not clearly a graph error), the graph appears moderately accurate but still has several catalog-truth/provenance gaps that can affect configuration and recommendations."

(2) The GDB 1800x900 weight of 36 kg for the short variant is almost certainly a PDF typo and is correctly flagged. (3) Material availability for GDMI and GDMI FLEX correctly excludes RF/SF but needs explicit prohibition notes. (4) Default materials need to be explicitly set for several families (GDMI FLEX should default to ZM, GDP and GDB to FZ). (5) The chlorine PPM data in the graph is not sourced from the PDF and should be clearly marked as external engineering data. (6) Module count data for GDB 600x900 appears incorrectly transcribed. (7) The PT/PTT naming discrepancy between contents page and product page is a minor PDF inconsistency.

    "summary": "The knowledge graph demonstrates strong overall fidelity to the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC Filterskåp catalog (Version 01-09-2025). All 12 product families are present, and the dimension tables for GDP (35 sizes), GDB (27 sizes), GDMI (35 sizes), GDC (12 sizes), GDC FLEX (6 sizes), GDMI FLEX (8 sizes), BFF (5 sizes), and PFF (25 sizes) are complete with correct airflow ratings, cartridge counts, and the vast majority of weight data matching the PDF. Material availability per family is correctly mapped in most cases, and accessory products (PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil) are all represented.\n\nThe most significant issues fall into three clusters. First, data accuracy: one GDB module count (600x900) is incorrectly transcribed, and one GDB weight (1800x900 short=36 kg) is a suspected PDF error that should be escalated rather than stored as-is. Second, semantic modeling: cartridge-based families (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) use 'max filter depth' terminology when the PDF describes cartridge cylinder lengths — a mismatch that can break filter compatibility logic. Third, governance and defaults: several families lack explicit default material assignments despite clear 'vanligen i...' statements in the PDF, and non-catalog engineering data (chlorine ppm, capacity rules, application heuristics) is not clearly separated from catalog-truth.\n\nWith the recommended corrections — particularly fixing the module count error, establishing default materials, renaming cartridge length properties, and improving provenance marking — the graph would achieve a high level of catalog integrity suitable for production use in configuration and recommendation systems."
