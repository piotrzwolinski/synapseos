It appears that data from the standard GDB family was copy-pasted to other families (GDC, GDMI, Flex) without adjusting for the specific tables in the PDF. Consequently, airflow ratings for cartridge and plan filter cabinets are dangerously overstated (using 3400 m³/h generic values instead of specific lower limits), and weights for double-walled/insulated units (GDMI) are understated. Additionally, significant portions of the size ranges (especially heights >600mm and widths >1800mm) are missing from the graph for multiple families."

GDP is especially problematic: the PDF defines a 250mm housing with its own airflow/weight table and required PFF frame counts and exact frame sizes; the graph instead references 550mm and mismatched values.\n\nCompleteness is also insufficient: GDMI in the PDF extends up to 2400x2400 with many additional rows that are missing in the graph; transition pieces (PT/TT) and accessories (EXL/Filter Profil) exist as families but have no instantiated variant data from the PDF tables. Finally, several metadata fields (construction type, chlorine ppm limits) are unverified or not present in the PDF and should be either sourced properly or separated as non-catalog enrichment to prevent incorrect recommendations."

      "summary": "The Knowledge Graph has severe and pervasive data quality issues that would render it unreliable for product selection and recommendation. The most critical systemic problem is that dimension module data (weights, airflows, reference lengths) appears to have been bulk-copied from the GDB 550/600mm variant and applied identically across GDP, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, GDMI FLEX, and PFF families. This means virtually every numeric value for non-GDB products is incorrect. GDP airflows are based on 1.5 m/s velocity (yielding values like 2000 m³/h for 600x600), while the graph stores 3400 m³/h (the GDB value). GDC and GDC FLEX use recommended flows per cartridge count (e.g., 2000 m³/h for 600x600 with 16 cartridges), not the 3400 m³/h stored. All weights are wrong for GDP (should be 4-42 kg range, not 14-92 kg), GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, and GDMI FLEX. All reference lengths are stored as 550mm regardless of the actual product family lengths (GDP=250mm, GDC=750/900mm, GDMI=600/850mm, etc.).\n\nThe second major issue is incomplete size coverage. GDMI is missing all sizes above 1800mm (10 sizes up to 2400x2400), GDP is missing 21 of 35 sizes, PFF is missing 13 of 26 sizes, and GDC is missing 2 sizes. Accessory products (BFF, PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil) have no dimension module data at all. Cartridge count capacity rules exist for only 2 sizes each for GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX, when the PDF provides counts for all sizes.\n\nThe graph structure and product family definitions are generally sound - all 12 product families are present, material availability is mostly correct (with minor default-material ambiguities for GDMI and GDMI FLEX), corrosion classes match, and the code format templates are structurally correct. However, the numeric data populating the graph is fundamentally unreliable and would lead to incorrect product recommendations, wrong weight estimates for logistics, and incorrect airflow sizing. A complete re-import of all dimension module data from the PDF tables is required."

      "final_assessment": "All three evaluators converge on the same critical systemic issues with the graph. The most severe and pervasive problem is that GDP data has been entirely populated with GDB values - wrong lengths (550 instead of 250mm), wrong weights (GDB 550/600 weights instead of GDP weights), wrong airflow values (module-based 3400 m³/h calculation instead of 1.5 m/s area-based calculation), and 21 of 35 sizes missing. Similarly, GDMI weights are copied from GDB rather than using the correct higher values from the GDMI table, and 10 large GDMI sizes (2100x and 2400x series) are completely absent. GDC and GDC FLEX families have incorrect airflow values (using module-based calculation instead of cartridge-based recommended flows) and incorrect weights (GDB weights instead of GDC-specific weights). GDC is also missing larger sizes with heights above 600mm. GDMI FLEX has the same weight and airflow issues. BFF dimension nodes appear to be missing entirely. The pattern strongly suggests the graph was initially built from GDB data and then the same data was incorrectly propagated to all other families without updating family-specific values. The graph requires a comprehensive rebuild of dimensional data for GDP, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX, and BFF families using the correct per-family tables from the PDF. Until these corrections are made, the graph is unreliable for any engineering or ordering purpose. The consensus score of 18/100 reflects that while the graph structure and some family-level metadata may be correct, the core dimensional/performance data is fundamentally wrong for the majority of product families."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph has a fundamentally sound high-level structure—all 12 product families from the PDF catalog are present, material definitions are largely correct, and the code format templates are structurally reasonable. However, the core dimensional and performance data is critically compromised by a systemic copy-paste error: dimension module data (weights, airflows, reference lengths) from the GDB 550/600mm variant appears to have been bulk-applied to GDP, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, GDMI FLEX, and PFF families without updating to their family-specific values. This means virtually every numeric value for 6 of 8 housing/frame families is incorrect.\n\nThe impact is severe across three dimensions. First, airflow ratings are dangerously overstated for GDP (e.g., 3400 vs. correct 2000 m³/h for 600x600), GDC (3400 vs. 2000), GDC FLEX (3400 vs. 1750), and GDMI FLEX (3400 vs. 1750)—using these values for system sizing would result in undersized filtration. Second, weights are wrong for all non-GDB families: GDP weights are approximately double the correct values, while GDMI weights are understated by 25-40% (single-wall vs. double-wall insulated). Third, reference lengths are stored as 550mm for families whose actual lengths range from 250mm (GDP) to 1100mm (GDMI FLEX). Additionally, size coverage is significantly truncated: GDP is missing 60% of its sizes, GDMI is missing all sizes above 1800mm, and accessory products (BFF, TT, PT, EXL, Filter Profil) have no instantiated variant data at all.\n\nThe graph in its current state is unreliable for engineering selection, logistics planning, or order generation. A comprehensive re-import of all family-specific tables from the PDF is required before the graph can be used for any production purpose. The consensus score of 15/100 reflects that while the structural skeleton is valid, the data populating it is fundamentally wrong for the majority of product families."
