However, the response duplicated the product card and omitted any application/environment checks or basic installation/service considerations, which limits completeness and safety communication.",

            "completeness": "It collected the missing length, but did not confirm connection type (PG vs flange), door handing, exact length variant (750 vs 800), or any context (indoor-only, filter type/depth) that typically affects selection.",
            "safety": "No warnings were provided (e.g., indoor-use limitation, access clearance for service door, or suitability of FZ in corrosive environments), though none were explicitly triggered by the user’s limited inputs.",

            "constraint_adherence": "Respects the catalog constraints for GDB size and length family and does not propose non-catalog materials/options; minor ambiguity remains because the catalog lists length as 750/800 rather than a single 750 mm value."
