The application exposes the system to Particulate Exposure, which will cause the activated carbon pores to get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory to capture the cement dust before it reaches the carbon filter. Therefore, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical pre-filtration.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC family provides the carbon filtration.Both stages will use the 900x600mm dimensions with an airflow of 2400 m³/h.
