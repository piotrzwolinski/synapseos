      "content": "This configuration is for a GDC filter in a pool air recirculation system. The system is exposed to high humidity and chlorine.The GDC housing has a C2 corrosion class. However, in environments with chlorine exposure, zinc-coated (C3) housings like the GDC will corrode rapidly. A minimum of C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) is required to withstand chlorine's effects.Additionally, the GDC filter housing is not rated for pool environments due to its SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. Therefore, this configuration is BLOCKED.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for pool environments and constructed with corrosion-resistant materials. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a multi-stage assembly, I need two details:What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?",
