The housing corrosion class is C2.To address these issues, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical filtration to capture particulates, protecting the downstream carbon filters.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDMI Modulfilterskåp provides activated carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors.

Acceptable alternatives are Aluzink (AZ) and ZinkMagnesium (ZM).To finalize the configuration, I need two details:",
