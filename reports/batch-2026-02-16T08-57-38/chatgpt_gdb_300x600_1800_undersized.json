It also outputs duplicate product cards and does not address the practical constraints of paralleling two 300x600 housings (manifold, balancing, footprint), making the selection logic weak and potentially misleading.",

            "completeness": "Misses key implementation details for a parallel arrangement (required manifold/transition pieces, balancing dampers, resulting face velocity/pressure drop targets) and provides no alternative single-housing selection aligned to the requested 300x600 duct size.",
            "safety": "No unsafe material/environment advice given; it correctly flags exceedance of the recommended flow, but does not warn about operational risks of parallel banks (maldistribution) beyond that.",
            "tone": "Professional and appropriately technical, with a clear clarification question for length.",
            "reasoning_quality": "Uses a hard cutoff at 1700 m³/h and jumps to “2 units required” instead of discussing acceptable exceedance margin, design velocity, or offering a reasoned trade-off (Δp/energy/noise).",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates practical product/application constraints by recommending two separate GDB housings in parallel without specifying a valid combined housing/bank solution from the catalog (e.g., larger W×H size) and duplicates the same product card twice."
