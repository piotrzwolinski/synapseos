The single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.The system will be exposed to Salt Spray, Outdoor Condensation, and High Humidity. Salt spray accelerates corrosion on the C2-rated galvanized steel (FZ) housing. Outdoor condensation will form on the housing's non-insulated metal surfaces. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 will use a GDP Planfilterskåp as a PROTECTOR to pre-filter the air. Stage 2 will use a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the TARGET filter. The GDMI is approved for marine environments.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:Minimum Ambient Temperature: What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?Relative Humidity: What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",
