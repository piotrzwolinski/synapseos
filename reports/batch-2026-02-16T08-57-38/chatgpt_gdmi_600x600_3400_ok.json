However, the final product code and weight do not match the PDF conventions/data (GDMI standard examples show AZ, and the 600/650 length is specified as 600/650—not a single fixed 600), and the response duplicates the product card.",

            "constraint_adherence": "Violates catalog constraints by outputting a non-catalog-standard length designation (600 instead of 600/650) and a questionable material/code mapping (GDMI examples specify AZ), plus incorrect weight."
