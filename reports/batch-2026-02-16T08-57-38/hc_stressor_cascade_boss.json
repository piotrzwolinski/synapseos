      "content": "For the rooftop kitchen exhaust at the hospital in a marine climate, the GDC FLEX is unsuitable. The GDC FLEX housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall construction, which is not rated for marine environments. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel, and the single-wall construction will cause condensation due to the high humidity and outdoor conditions.To provide a complete solution, we recommend a two-stage filtration system:The first stage is a GDP Planfilterskåp for mechanical pre-filtration to protect the second stage from Grease/Oil Exposure, which will irreversibly deactivate the carbon. The second stage is a GDMI Modulfilterskåp for gas/odor/VOC removal, which is necessary due to Chemical Vapor Exposure from the kitchen exhaust. The GDMI will use activated carbon adsorption to capture gas-phase contaminants.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:Minimum Ambient Temperature: What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?Additionally, the requested 3000 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 1200x600 mm module can handle 3500 m³/h.",
