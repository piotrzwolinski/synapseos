However, the system failed to carry through the requested material (FZ) into the product code/specs and duplicated the product card, which is a catalog/ordering constraint issue.",

            "completeness": "Collected length and returned a selection, but did not confirm/encode material, connection type (PG vs flange), door handing, or note the 900/950 length convention vs “900mm”.",
            "safety": "No unsafe advice given; indoor C2 statement is acceptable for FZ in typical indoor environments, though it should have confirmed any chemical exposure/condensation risk if relevant.",
            "tone": "Professional and concise, suitable for technical sales support.",
            "reasoning_quality": "Logic is mostly straightforward (size matches airflow; ask for missing length), but it doesn’t explain the 900/950 mm length option mapping and ignores the material requirement.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates ordering/spec constraint by not including material (FZ) and other required code fields (e.g., R/L, PG/F) despite user specifying FZ; also outputs duplicate product cards."
