Salt spray can cause C3-rated materials to fail prematurely. Additionally, Outdoor Condensation can occur on non-insulated metal surfaces.To address this, the system will use a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage to capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI unit. This ensures the GDMI's C3 rating is sufficient for your needs. The housing corrosion class is C4.Please note that while you requested Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316), this material is not available for the GDMI product family. Available materials include Aluzink and Zinkmagnesium ZM310.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",

The GDMI filter housing is C4-rated for corrosion resistance.Salt spray can accelerate corrosion of standard materials. High humidity also contributes to corrosion, potentially reducing the lifespan of the filter system. Outdoor installations are subject to condensation when the surface temperature drops below the dew point. To mitigate these risks, a two-stage filtration system is recommended.The first stage, a GDP Planfilterskåp, provides corrosion resistance C5.1 and captures salt spray upstream, protecting the GDMI filter. The second stage is the GDMI filter itself, providing corrosion resistance C3.**Note**: Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless). Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments.
