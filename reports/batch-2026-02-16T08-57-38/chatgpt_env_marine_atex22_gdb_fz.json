The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall uninsulated construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Salt spray will accelerate corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ) housing.Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. To address these issues, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system using the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. The GDMI housing has a C2 corrosion class.To protect the GDMI, I've included a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage. This configuration also addresses the explosive atmosphere (ATEX Zone 22) by ensuring proper grounding and the use of anti-static filter media to prevent spark ignition.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:First, what is the reference airflow for the system?Second, to assess the risk of condensation, I need the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
