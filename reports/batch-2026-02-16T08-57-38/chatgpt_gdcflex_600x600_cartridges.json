            "completeness": "It failed to clearly restate/confirm the answer to “how many cartridges” in the final response and omitted key configuration attributes (lucka, anslutning, material) that the catalog’s ordering convention requires.",

            "reasoning_quality": "Logic flow (confirm selection → ask for missing length → provide configuration) is reasonable, but the corrosion-class discussion is a bit muddled (mixing housing ‘C2’ with material ‘C3’) and not tied to a clear decision.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates catalog/order-code constraints by outputting an incomplete/nonstandard product code and not respecting the catalog’s length notation (750/800, 900/950) and required suffix fields."
