The GDB uses mechanical filtration, which is ineffective for gas/odor/VOC removal. For chemical vapors, activated carbon adsorption is required.Additionally, the powder coating line creates an Explosive Atmosphere. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. This configuration requires grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components to prevent static discharge.Given these constraints, the GDB is vetoed. I recommend the GDC_FLEX-1200x600 for this application. To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the required airflow (m³/h)?",
