Please select an available material to proceed.The GDMI family is designed to provide Corrosion Resistance C3. However, given the coastal industrial facility application, the system is exposed to salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials are not suitable for marine environments.To address this, I am designing a two-stage filtration system. The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp, which provides Corrosion Resistance C5.1 and captures salt spray upstream, protecting the GDMI filter in the second stage. Both stages will use the 600x600mm duct dimensions you provided.I also need to gather some additional information to finalize the configuration. The outdoor installation exposes the system to outdoor condensation and high humidity. To ensure proper performance and prevent condensation on the housing, I need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.Finally, for both the GDP Planfilterskåp (Stage 1) and the GDMI filter (Stage 2), I need to know the housing length. Which housing length do you need for each?",

Condensation forms on non-insulated metal surfaces when the surface temperature drops below the dew point. An insulated (double-wall) housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.The system is also exposed to High Humidity, which accelerates zinc corrosion and reduces service life.
