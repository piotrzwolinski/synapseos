The dimensions, airflows, and material codes for the main families (GDP, GDB, GDC, GDMI) are mapped correctly.\n\nThe primary discrepancies involve the 'GDC FLEX' 600x300 size, where the PDF labels it '600x300' but defines the width as 300mm, creating a potential naming convention conflict in the graph. Additionally, while the cabinets are well-represented, the specific consumable filter products (Airsquare, Scandsorb, etc.) detailed in the 'Accessories' sections of the PDF are missing from the graph. Adding these would significantly enhance the graph's utility for complete system configuration."

All 12 product families from the PDF are present in the graph, and the dimensional data (sizes, weights, airflows, cartridge counts, filter module configurations) has been transcribed with remarkable accuracy across all product families. Every row in every dimension table was verified, and no numeric transcription errors were found. The graph correctly captures 35 GDP sizes, 27 GDB sizes, 35 GDMI sizes (including the extended 2100/2400 range), 12 GDC sizes, 6 GDC FLEX sizes, 8 GDMI FLEX sizes, 5 BFF sizes, 25 PFF sizes, 5 PT entries, 35 TT entries, 8 EXL lengths, and 36 Filter Profil combinations.\n\nThe most notable issues are: (1) GDMI FLEX material availability where the graph includes FZ but the PDF material icons only show AZ and ZM - though the example code contradictorily uses FZ; (2) The GDMI FLEX weight column header duplication on PDF page 18 which the graph correctly flags as a source conflict; (3) The GDB 1800x900 weight anomaly (36 kg) which is correctly flagged as a suspected PDF error. The graph has done an excellent job of documenting source conflicts and ambiguities rather than silently resolving them.\n\nAreas for potential improvement include: ensuring default materials are explicitly set for all families (GDC FLEX lacks a default), and potentially enriching the code format templates to show variable positions for options like hinge side and connection type. The Layer 2 data (environments, applications, stressors) goes beyond what the PDF catalog provides and represents value-added intelligence that cannot be directly verified against this source document. Overall, the graph earns a score of 72/100, reflecting strong data accuracy with some minor material availability ambiguities and the inherent challenges of source document inconsistencies."

Key areas requiring attention include: (1) the GDC FLEX 600x300 naming convention where PDF labels conflict with the Bredd/Höjd column values, (2) material availability accuracy for GDMI FLEX which should include FZ, AZ, ZM but exclude RF and SF, (3) the PTT/PT alias from the table of contents, and (4) missing accessory items like the kolcylinder mounting handle (article 7532011197). The consumable filter examples from the PDF are illustrative rather than exhaustive, so their absence as distinct graph nodes is a minor gap rather than a critical omission. The graph's handling of PDF source conflicts through explicit flags is commendable and represents good data governance practice. Overall accuracy is estimated at 75%, with the primary deductions coming from material availability edge cases, the GDC FLEX dimension labeling issue, and missing accessory/option detail rather than fundamental structural errors."

      "2. FIX GDC FLEX 600x300 NAMING: Rename to 300x600 to match WxH convention and actual Bredd=300/Höjd=600 values, or add explicit width/height properties to resolve the ambiguity.",
      "3. MATERIAL AVAILABILITY CLEANUP: Ensure GDMI and GDMI FLEX explicitly exclude RF and SF (per 'Ej i rostfritt'). Set FZ as default for GDC FLEX. Verify PT material availability for the greyed RF icon.",
      "4. DIFFERENTIATE FLOW RATE BASES: Tag GDP flows as 'at 1.5 m/s' and GDB/GDMI flows as 'per 3400 m³/h module basis' to prevent cross-family misinterpretation.",
      "5. CAPTURE TESTING SCOPE DIFFERENCES: GDP/GDB/GDMI include filter bypass leakage testing; GDC/GDC FLEX/GDMI FLEX do not.",
      "6. ADD CYLINDER-LENGTH MAPPINGS: Explicitly map cabinet lengths to supported cylinder configurations for GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX families.",
      "7. ENRICH CODE FORMAT TEMPLATES: Show variable positions for hinge side (R/L) and connection type (PG/F) across all applicable families.",
      "8. ADD PTT ALIAS: Add 'PTT' as a search alias for 'PT' to match the table of contents reference.",
      "9. CONSIDER ADDING EXAMPLE FILTER/ACCESSORY NODES: Ingest specific filter SKUs and the kolcylinder mounting handle (7532011197) as compatible product references to enhance system configuration utility."

    "summary": "The Knowledge Graph demonstrates excellent fidelity to the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC Filterskåp catalog (Version 01-09-2025). All 12 product families from the PDF are represented, and the dimensional data across 237+ size entries has been transcribed with remarkable accuracy — no numeric transcription errors were found in any dimension table. The graph correctly captures weights, airflows, cartridge counts, filter module configurations, and connection specifications for every product variant.\n\nThe graph's most commendable quality is its handling of source document inconsistencies. The PDF contains several internal conflicts and suspected typographical errors: the GDMI length text vs. table discrepancy (page 11 vs. 12), the GDMI FLEX duplicate weight column headers (page 18), and the GDB 1800x900 anomalous weight (page 9). In each case, the graph has made reasonable interpretive choices and documented the conflicts with SOURCE_CONFLICT flags, representing sound data governance practice.\n\nThe primary areas for improvement are: (1) the GDC FLEX 600x300 size naming convention conflict where the label contradicts the Bredd/Höjd columns; (2) material availability precision, particularly ensuring GDMI and GDMI FLEX correctly exclude stainless steel variants (RF/SF) per the 'Ej i rostfritt' statements; (3) enriching metadata to capture testing scope differences between product families, flow rate calculation bases, and cylinder-to-cabinet-length compatibility mappings; and (4) adding compatible filter and accessory product references from the 'Filter & Tillbehör' pages. These are refinement opportunities rather than fundamental accuracy issues, and the overall graph quality is strong."
