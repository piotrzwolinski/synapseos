The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall uninsulated construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Salt spray will accelerate corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ) housing.To provide a suitable solution for your offshore platform, I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. This configuration requires a multi-stage assembly:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp to provide upstream filtration.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDMI Modulfilterskåp for the main filtration.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
