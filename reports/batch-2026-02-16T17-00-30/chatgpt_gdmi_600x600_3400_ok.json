It also provides almost no engineering context (filter depth/length selection, access side, connection option), which weakens the recommendation quality.",

            "correctness": "PDF shows GDMI 600x600 has rated airflow 3400 m³/h, but the card’s “Weight ~34 kg” conflicts with the GDMI table (43 kg for 850/900 and 34 kg for 600/650) and it incorrectly states “ZM (corrosion class C5)” while the catalog’s material section lists ZM310 as C5 and GDMI text indicates GDMI is usually ZM with corrosion class C4—engineering reasoning is minimal and not clearly justified.",
            "completeness": "Missing key configuration items (door hinge side, PG vs flange, which of 600/650 length variant, filter type/depth) and no mention of expected pressure drop or filter selection implications.",
            "safety": "No unsafe advice given, but it omits practical warnings (service clearance, condensation/hygiene considerations, correct corrosion-class selection rationale) that are relevant even for indoor insulated housings.",
            "tone": "Professional and appropriately concise for a technical sales interaction.",
            "reasoning_quality": "Logic is mostly a parameter-collection flow; it does not explain why 600 mm length is appropriate vs 850/900 for long bag/compact filters, and it asserts corrosion class without a clear chain.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates catalog consistency by outputting a non-catalog length label (“600mm” instead of 600/650) and duplicating the same product card twice; also mixes corrosion-class claims (C4 vs C5) without aligning to the GDMI section."
