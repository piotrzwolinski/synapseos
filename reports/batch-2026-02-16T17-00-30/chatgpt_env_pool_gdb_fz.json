However, the requested FZ (C3) material is not suitable for environments with chlorine exposure. The zinc coating will dissolve within months. To ensure longevity, a minimum of C5 corrosion resistance is required.To address this, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp with C5 corrosion resistance to capture chlorine upstream, preventing it from reaching the target stage.Stage 2 (TARGET): A filter housing with C5 corrosion resistance.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?",

Chlorine aggressively attacks the zinc coating, leading to failure within months. For this application, we require a minimum of C5 corrosion resistance.To provide a complete filtration solution, I recommend a two-stage assembly:Stage 1 will be a GDP Planfilterskåp to pre-filter the air and protect the downstream GDB filter from Chlorine Exposure.
