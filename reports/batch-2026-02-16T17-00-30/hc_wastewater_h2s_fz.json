The housing itself has corrosion class C2.Additionally, the GDB filter housing is not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation. The SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Therefore, this configuration is BLOCKED. No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously.A suitable solution would need to be constructed from a material with a higher corrosion resistance (minimum C5 such as RF or SF) and be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation, with a construction that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
