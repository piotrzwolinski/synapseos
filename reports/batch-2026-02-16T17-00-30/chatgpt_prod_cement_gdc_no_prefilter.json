The exhaust contains fine cement dust, representing a significant Particulate Exposure risk. Particulates will quickly clog the activated carbon pores, rendering the gas adsorption function useless. Mechanical pre-filtration is mandatory to remove the dust before it reaches the carbon filter.Therefore, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical filtration to capture the cement dust.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC family provides the carbon adsorption.Both stages will use the 900x600mm duct dimensions you specified.
