      "content": "This GDB filter housing configuration is blocked for your offshore application due to the marine environment. The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall uninsulated construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Salt spray from the marine environment will also accelerate corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ) housing.Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. Finally, the presence of an explosive atmosphere (ATEX Zone 22) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition.To address these issues, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system using the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage to extend the life of the GDMI. To proceed, I need to know the airflow for both stages, as well as the minimum ambient temperature and relative humidity at the installation site to evaluate the risk of condensation.What is the airflow (m³/h)?High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
