The single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet leakage and hygiene requirements, and the C2 housing is not rated for salt spray, which accelerates corrosion. To ensure proper filtration and longevity, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system.This system will address several environmental stressors present in your application, including High Humidity, Chemical Vapor Exposure, Outdoor Condensation, Grease/Oil Exposure, Salt Spray, and Hygiene Requirements. Grease/Oil Exposure is particularly critical, as lipids can permanently deactivate carbon filters. The solution involves a mechanical pre-filter (GDP Planfilterskåp) to capture grease and particulate, followed by a carbon filter (GDMI Modulfilterskåp) for odor and gas removal.The system will consist of two stages, both using 600x600mm modules to handle the 3000 m³/h airflow. Since the required airflow exceeds the capacity of a single 600x600 module, we'll need two modules in parallel, resulting in effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm. To finalize the configuration, I need the filter depth for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp.What is the filter depth for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp?",

          "text": "For the rooftop kitchen exhaust at the hospital, the GDC_FLEX filter you requested is not suitable for marine environments. The single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet leakage and hygiene requirements, and the C2 housing is not rated for salt spray, which accelerates corrosion. To ensure proper filtration and longevity, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system."

Grease/Oil Exposure is particularly critical, as lipids can permanently deactivate carbon filters. The solution involves a mechanical pre-filter (GDP Planfilterskåp) to capture grease and particulate, followed by a carbon filter (GDMI Modulfilterskåp) for odor and gas removal."

Since the required airflow exceeds the capacity of a single 600x600 module, we'll need two modules in parallel, resulting in effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm. To finalize the configuration, I need the filter depth for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp."
