The system is exposed to outdoor condensation, high humidity, and salt spray.Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, making standard C3-rated materials unsuitable for marine environments. High humidity can also accelerate corrosion. To address these concerns, we recommend a two-stage filtration system.The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp (PROTECTOR) with C5.1 corrosion resistance to capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the second stage. The second stage will be a GDMI family (TARGET) filter housing, providing the required C3 corrosion resistance, protected by the upstream stage.Please note that while you requested Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) for the GDMI housing, this material is not available for the GDMI product family. Available materials are Aluzink and Zinkmagnesium ZM310. The GDMI housing itself has a C4 corrosion class.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",

Additionally, the outdoor installation introduces the risk of outdoor condensation.The GDMI family is suitable for corrosion class C3 environments, but the presence of salt spray requires a corrosion resistance of C5.1. To address this, the system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage.The GDP pre-filter captures salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI stage and ensuring the system's longevity. Outdoor condensation is addressed by the GDMI housing's C4 corrosion class.Here is the configuration:**Note**: Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless). Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Outdoor installations cause condensation when surface temperature drops below the dew point. Insulated (double-wall) housing maintains surface temperature above dew point, preventing water damage to filters. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
