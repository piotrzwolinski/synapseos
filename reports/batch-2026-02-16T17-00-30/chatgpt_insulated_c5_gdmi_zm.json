Please select an available material to proceed.For your coastal industrial facility, we're designing a two-stage filtration system to provide corrosion resistance. The system will address the challenges of outdoor condensation, high humidity, and salt spray.The GDMI family is suitable for C3 corrosion resistance, but is not rated for the marine environment. Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, leading to premature failure of C3-rated materials. To solve this, we will use a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector.The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp to capture salt spray upstream, protecting the GDMI filter. The second stage will be the GDMI filter itself, providing the required C3 corrosion resistance. Both stages will use 600x600mm dimensions and handle an airflow of 3400 m³/h.I need two more details to finalize the configuration:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",

The system will consist of a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage and a GDMI family filter as the target stage. The GDMI family is typically used indoors, but we can adapt it for your application.The GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, and the C3-rated materials in the standard GDMI will fail prematurely. To address this, the system will use a GDP Planfilterskåp as a pre-filter. The GDP provides C5.1 corrosion resistance and captures salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI filter.Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. To prevent this, the GDMI housing requires a double-wall insulated housing to maintain the surface above the dew point. The minimum housing length for the insulated GDMI is 600mm. Your specified housing length of 250mm for the GDMI has been auto-corrected to 600mm to meet this requirement.To finalize the configuration:High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
