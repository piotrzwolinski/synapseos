            "correctness": "PDF shows GDB 1500x1200 has Flöde 17,000 m³/h and weight 77 kg (for 750/800 length), but the assistant’s product card inconsistently reports “Rated Airflow 16,000 m³/h” and the weight is not verified as tied to the chosen length; engineering reasoning is minimal and does not validate face velocity/selection margin.",
            "completeness": "It does not confirm whether 16,000 m³/h is acceptable vs the catalog flow basis, nor does it address pressure drop, filter type (short/long bag), or connection option (PG vs flange) beyond defaulting to PG.",
            "safety": "No explicit unsafe advice is given, but it misses a key operational risk: running above the catalog flow basis can drive high Δp, noise, and bypass risk if sealing/locking is not adequate.",

            "reasoning_quality": "The logic is mostly a parameter-fill exercise (size/material/length) with little transparent engineering check (e.g., velocity, Δp, service access), and it contains an internal inconsistency between stated and card airflow.",
            "constraint_adherence": "It violates catalog/selection constraints by not flagging that requested 16,000 m³/h is higher than the catalog flow for GDB 1500x1200 (17,000 is the table value but the card overwrites it to 16,000), and it outputs duplicate product cards."
