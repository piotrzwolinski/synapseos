      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the requested GDC_FLEX filter is not suitable due to several environmental factors. The system is exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure from the cleanroom environment, as well as Outdoor Condensation and Hygiene Requirements.The GDC_FLEX is vetoed because it uses carbon adsorption, which is ineffective against solid particulates, and its single-wall uninsulated construction does not prevent condensation in outdoor environments. This configuration is therefore BLOCKED.The recommended alternative is a two-stage filtration system using a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target filter. This setup provides both mechanical filtration for particulate capture and activated carbon adsorption for gas/odor/VOC removal, addressing the requirements for Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure. The GDMI is also approved for pharmaceutical environments.The GDMI Modulfilterskåp is available in Aluzink (AZ) or ZinkMagnesium (ZM).To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",
