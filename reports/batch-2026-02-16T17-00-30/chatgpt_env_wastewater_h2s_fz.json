The specified FZ (C3 galvanized) material is not suitable for environments with H2S, as it corrodes rapidly. Additionally, mechanical filters like those used in the GDB cannot capture gas-phase contaminants like chemical vapors.The product is not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation because its single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To resolve this, a solution would need to be constructed from a material with a corrosion class of C5 or higher (such as stainless steel) and be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation.
