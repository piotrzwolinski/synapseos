The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall uninsulated construction, making it vulnerable to corrosion and condensation in marine environments. This configuration is therefore BLOCKED.To provide a suitable solution, we recommend a two-stage filtration system. This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target stage. The GDMI is approved for marine environments. The protector stage is physically necessary to protect the target stage from the environmental stressors.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What filter depth do you need for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp?",
