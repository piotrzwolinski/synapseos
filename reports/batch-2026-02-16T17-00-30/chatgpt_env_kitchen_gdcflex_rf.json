      "content": "For the restaurant exhaust application, the GDC_FLEX is designed for chemical vapor exposure. However, in kitchen environments, grease and oil exposure is also a concern. Lipids will irreversibly coat the activated carbon, which reduces its ability to adsorb chemical vapors.To address this, we recommend a two-stage filtration system:The first stage uses a GDP Planfilterskåp to remove grease and particulate, protecting the downstream carbon filter. The second stage uses the GDC_FLEX to handle chemical vapor.The system requires 2x units with effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm to handle the 2500 m³/h airflow. The housing corrosion class is C2.Additionally, the requested 2500 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 2500 m³/h.**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Kitchen/grease environments need mechanical pre-filtration before any carbon stage to protect carbon from lipid contamination. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Even trace grease permanently deactivates carbon. A pre-filter stage is mandatory for any application where grease, oil, or fat is present in the airstream. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
