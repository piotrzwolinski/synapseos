The GDC housing has a C2 corrosion class and is constructed from FZ (C3) material, which is not suitable for the chlorine environment. Chlorine exposure will cause the zinc coating to dissolve within months. High humidity will also accelerate the corrosion of the zinc, reducing its service life.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. The product is not rated for ENV_POOL installation because it uses SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_POOL installation and use a construction type other than SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED.I recommend contacting the manufacturer's Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the configuration, I need to know the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm).",
