However, GDB housings with corrosion class C2 are not suitable for outdoor environments due to the risk of condensation.Outdoor installation exposes the system to high humidity and outdoor condensation. Because GDB housings use single-wall uninsulated construction, condensation will form on the metal surfaces. To prevent this, double-wall insulated housings are required to maintain the surface above the dew point.Therefore, the GDB filter housing is blocked for this application. I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for outdoor use.
