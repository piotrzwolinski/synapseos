This design does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine installations, and is prone to condensation and corrosion from Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray.I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?Additionally, the requested 2600 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 2000 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 3000 m³/h.",
