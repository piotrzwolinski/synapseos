            "completeness": "It collected length but did not confirm connection type (PG vs flange), door handing, or whether a police filter/600 mm cylinders were needed, and it gave no guidance on media selection or pressure drop implications.",

            "reasoning_quality": "Reasoning is largely absent and includes a clear contradiction (calling the housing C2 while specifying RF/C5), with no transparent selection logic beyond matching size/flow.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates catalog constraints by offering GDC FLEX in RF stainless and generating a corresponding product code, whereas the catalog describes GDC FLEX as typically galvanized (FZ) with C2 for this family."
