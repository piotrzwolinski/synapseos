The main issue is a material/corrosion-class inconsistency (FZ labeled as C3 in the card while the GDC section states C2), and the interaction lacks any application-side checks (e.g., need for downstream particle/polish filter, media selection, pressure drop).",

            "completeness": "Collected the missing length and produced a valid code, but did not ask for key design inputs like target contaminant/media type, desired residence time, allowable Δp, or whether a polish filter is required.",
            "safety": "No unsafe recommendation for the stated indoor warehouse use, but it missed a relevant risk note that carbon cartridges can shed dust and the catalog explicitly mentions an optional downstream polisfilter for sensitive applications.",
