The zinc coating (C3) on the galvanized steel will corrode rapidly in the presence of chlorine and persistent humidity, leading to premature failure. A minimum of C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) is required for chlorine environments.To address this, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp: Captures Chlorine Exposure upstream, preventing it from reaching the Corrosion Resistance C3 stage.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDB family: Provides primary Corrosion Resistance C3 function, protected by upstream stage.To proceed with the configuration, I need two details: What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)? What is the required airflow capacity (m³/h)?",
