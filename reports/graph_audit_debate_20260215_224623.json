The biggest integrity risk found is the unresolved dimensional inconsistency in the GDC FLEX table row labeled 600x300 where the PDF’s Bredd/Höjd columns appear swapped; the graph currently stores contradictory width/height semantics, which can cause incorrect product sizing and code generation (CRITICAL). The second major gap is that several options (polisfilter rail) are present but not modeled as a selectable, constraint-bearing feature because no code token is given in the PDF; this limits correct configuration and recommendation behavior (MAJOR).",
      "summary_continued": "Most remaining issues are modeling precision: distinguishing airflow reference bases (PFF uses 1.5 m/s through free area), encoding standard vs on-request materials for PT/TT, and capturing construction metadata like aluminum profile frame for GDMI/GDMI FLEX. Additionally, the catalog itself contains at least one likely typo (GDB 1800x900 short weight = 36 kg), but the graph should match the PDF exactly and track suspected errors separately rather than implying corrected values."

      "summary": "The Knowledge Graph demonstrates a high level of fidelity to the PDF catalog, with all 12 product families correctly represented and the vast majority of dimensional data, weights, airflow ratings, and cartridge counts accurately captured. The graph contains 273 DimensionModule nodes covering all sizes from every table in the PDF, and cross-checking confirms that numeric values (weights, airflows, cartridge counts, dimensions) are correctly stored for GDP (35 sizes), GDB (27 sizes), GDMI (35 sizes including extended 2100/2400 ranges), GDC (12 sizes), GDC FLEX (6 sizes), GDMI FLEX (8 sizes), BFF (5 sizes), PFF (25 sizes), PT (5 sizes), TT (35 sizes), EXL (8 sizes), and Filter Profil (36 combinations).\n\nThe most significant finding is the GDMI FLEX material availability discrepancy: the graph lists FZ as an available material, but the PDF page 18 material icons show only AZ and ZM. This is a CRITICAL issue as it could lead to incorrect product recommendations. The graph also correctly identifies and documents several PDF source inconsistencies, including the GDMI FLEX weight column header error (both columns labeled 1100/1150), the GDB 1800x900 suspected weight typo (36 kg), the GDMI text vs. table length discrepancy, and the GDC FLEX dimension label inconsistency. These SOURCE_CONFLICT annotations demonstrate good data governance practices.\n\nOverall, the graph scores well on completeness and accuracy. The primary areas for improvement are: (1) correcting the GDMI FLEX material list, (2) continuing to flag and track the identified PDF source errors for resolution with the manufacturer, and (3) ensuring all source conflict notes are surfaced appropriately to downstream consumers of the data. The environmental, application, and dependency rule layers (Layer 2) appear to be supplementary enrichment beyond the PDF scope and were not audited against the PDF source."

The GDMI FLEX material-icon dispute raised by another evaluator appears incorrect: the GDMI FLEX page shows FZ/AZ/ZM icons, so FZ should not be removed solely on icon evidence. A real data-quality risk remains in GDC FLEX’s first size row where the printed size label contradicts the Bredd/Höjd columns (page 16).

The most significant confirmed issues center on material availability for GDMI and GDMI FLEX families, where the graph must strictly follow the material icons (AZ/ZM only for GDMI; FZ/AZ/ZM for GDMI FLEX) rather than inferring broader availability. The GDMI length text-vs-table discrepancy (550/600 vs 600/650) is correctly handled by the graph using table values with a SOURCE_CONFLICT flag. The GDB 1800x900 weight anomaly (36 kg) is appropriately flagged as a suspected PDF error. The GDMI FLEX weight column header duplication is a clear PDF error that the graph correctly infers around. The GDC FLEX dimension label inconsistency needs explicit flagging. For PT and TT transitions, the graph should clearly distinguish standard materials (FZ only) from on-request materials, citing the 'Övriga material... tillverkas på begäran' note. The EXL code format space-vs-hyphen ambiguity is a minor but valid concern for downstream systems. Overall, the graph captures the vast majority of product data correctly but needs refinement in material availability modeling, explicit source conflict documentation, and handling of PDF internal inconsistencies."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph demonstrates strong overall fidelity to the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC Filterskåp catalog (Version 01-09-2025). All 12 product families are correctly represented, and comprehensive verification of 237+ dimension entries across all product tables confirms that the vast majority of numeric data—sizes, weights, airflow ratings, cartridge counts, and filter compatibility dimensions—are accurately captured. The graph also correctly identifies and documents several PDF source inconsistencies, including the GDMI text-vs-table length discrepancy, the GDMI FLEX weight column header duplication, and the GDB 1800x900 suspected weight typo. These SOURCE_CONFLICT annotations demonstrate good data governance practices.\n\nThe most significant integrity risk is the GDC FLEX dimension table inconsistency where the first row's size label ('600x300') contradicts the Bredd/Höjd columns (300/600). This CRITICAL issue can cause incorrect dimensional filtering and code generation if not properly resolved. The second major area of concern is material availability modeling: GDMI should be restricted to [AZ, ZM] per its icon row, GDMI FLEX should be [FZ, AZ, ZM] with ZM as default, and PT/TT should clearly distinguish standard (FZ) from on-request materials. Several polisfilter rail options lack proper constraint modeling despite being documented in the PDF.\n\nOverall, the graph earns an 88/100 accuracy score. The dimensional data layer is excellent (near-perfect), the product family structure is complete, and the code format conventions are well-captured. The primary improvement areas are material availability precision, constraint rule formalization for filter depth limits and polisfilter options, and resolution of the handful of PDF source inconsistencies that propagate into the graph. With the recommended fixes applied, the graph would achieve 95+ accuracy."
