The primary structural issue is in the GDMI family, where the weight values for standard and long versions are swapped (Critical). This likely occurred because the PDF tables for GDB and GDMI reverse the column order (Long/Short vs Short/Long), and the ingestion process did not account for this switch.\n\nAdditionally, there are missing weight values for the 'Long' variants of the GDC and GDMI FLEX families for specific sizes (Major). Material availability is mostly correct, though the GDMI family is missing the Stainless Steel (RF) option implied by the general catalog description. Finally, the graph description for GDMI reflects a text error in the PDF regarding housing lengths, although the actual dimension data in the graph is correct."

These can directly lead to wrong product configuration recommendations and incorrect logistics/handling data.\n\nA second cluster of issues concerns over-asserted or non-catalog claims: materials listed as broadly available for frames/accessories (BFF/PFF/EXL/PT) beyond what the PDF states as standard, and construction-type metadata (bolted) that is not evidenced in the catalog. Finally, several important catalog semantics are missing: GDP length incorrectly modeled as 250/300; PFF depth variants not enumerated; service-door side specificity ('Lucksida = Höjdsida'); and transition (+40mm envelope) connection rules. Addressing these will improve correctness of code generation, compatibility checks, and recommendation logic."

The most significant structural issues are: (1) systematic confusion between quarter-module (¼) and half-module (½) counts across GDB and GDMI families, where values appear shifted between columns in approximately 8-10 size entries; (2) the GDB 1800x900 short weight is critically wrong (63 kg in graph vs 36 kg in PDF); and (3) GDP reference lengths are stored as '250/300' when the PDF only specifies 250mm.\n\nWeight data completeness is a notable gap - GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX are missing their longer-housing weight values for multiple sizes, even though the PDF provides these. The GDMI weight column ordering appears inverted compared to GDB convention (heavier weight stored as primary rather than secondary), which could cause confusion in application logic.\n\nMaterial availability is generally accurate, with GDMI correctly limited to AZ/ZM and GDMI FLEX to FZ/AZ/ZM. The corrosion class assignments match the PDF. Key product features like the pull-out carbon filter plate for FLEX variants and the polisfilter rail option are partially captured but could be more explicit. Overall, the graph is approximately 75-80% accurate at the individual cell level, with the primary remediation needed in filter module counts, missing weight data, and the GDP length representation."

The Gemini finding about GDMI missing RF material was challenged - 'Ei i Rostfritt' is clearly a typo for 'Ej' (Not in stainless), matching GDMI FLEX's explicit exclusion, and the material icons on page 11 only show AZ and ZM. The OpenAI findings about construction type 'BOLTED' are valid observations but should be downgraded to INFO severity since the catalog simply doesn't address this attribute. The corrosion class discrepancy between material-level (FZ=C3) and product-level (GDP/GDB/GDC=C2) noted by OpenAI is a legitimate modeling concern that needs architectural resolution. Overall, the graph captures the dimensional data, airflow values, and cartridge counts accurately, but has systematic issues with weight data completeness and column mapping, a GDP length error, and some material/corrosion class modeling ambiguities."

    "summary": "The MANN+HUMMEL HVAC filter cabinet knowledge graph successfully captures all 12 product families from the PDF catalog and generally represents dimensional data, airflow ratings, and cartridge counts accurately. Material availability is correctly modeled for most families, with GDMI properly limited to AZ/ZM and GDMI FLEX to FZ/AZ/ZM (both correctly excluding stainless steel). The graph's overall structure aligns well with the catalog's product hierarchy.\n\nHowever, several critical and systematic data integrity issues were identified by multiple independent evaluators. The most impactful are: (1) GDP reference length incorrectly stored as '250/300' instead of the catalog's single 250mm value; (2) GDMI weight columns are inverted relative to the convention used in other families, storing the long-housing weight as the primary 'Weight' field; (3) GDB 1800x900 short weight is incorrect (63 vs PDF's 36 kg); and (4) missing long-variant weight data across GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX families despite the PDF providing complete data. Additionally, a systematic column-shift error in filter module counts (¼ vs ½) affects approximately 8-10 size entries each in the GDB and GDMI families.\n\nBeyond data accuracy, the graph has structural modeling gaps: conditional configuration logic for patron cabinet length variants (where 900/950mm supports either 450mm+polisfilter or 600mm cartridges) is simplified to a single 'max depth' value; key differentiating features like the pull-out carbon filter plate for FLEX variants are not captured; and the corrosion class model conflates material-level and product-level ratings. Addressing the critical weight/length errors and the systematic module count issues should be the immediate priority, followed by the structural modeling improvements for configuration logic."
