The GDC-FLEX family is not rated for marine environments due to its RAIL_MOUNTED construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine (ENV_MARINE) installations. Additionally, the requested airflow of 3000 m³/h exceeds the maximum capacity of 1750 m³/h for a single 600x600 module, requiring 2 modules.The system is exposed to several stressors:- High Humidity- Chemical Vapor Exposure- Outdoor Condensation- Grease/Oil Exposure- Salt Spray- Hygiene RequirementsA solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation and provide sufficient airflow capacity. Since no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously, I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
