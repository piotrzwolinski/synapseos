### hc_lcc_four_small_housings — 1.7 FAIL

**Query:** We need 3400 m³/h. Instead of one 600x600 housing, we want four separate 300x300 housings.

**Judge Evaluations:**

**gemini** — 1.7 FAIL
| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| correctness | 1 |
| completeness | 2 |
| safety | 2 |
| tone | 5 |
| reasoning_quality | 1 |
| constraint_adherence | 1 |

*The system fails critically on factual accuracy and engineering logic. It recommends a GDP housing which has a maximum filter depth of 100mm (PDF p.3) for a requested 150mm depth, and hallucinates a housing length of 550mm for GDP (actual is 250mm). Most alarmingly, it displays a rated airflow of 23,800 m³/h for a 300x300mm housing, which is physically impossible and contradicts the catalog value of 500 m³/h.*

Strengths: Tone is appropriate
Weaknesses: Hallucinated product dimensions (GDP length); Physically impossible airflow ratings (23,800 m³/h for 300x300); Selected wrong product family (GDP instead of GDB/GDMI) for the requested depth; Incoherent math (7x multiplier for 4 requested units)

**openai** — 1.7 FAIL

|-----------|-------|
| correctness | 1 |
| completeness | 1 |
| safety | 2 |
| tone | 4 |
| reasoning_quality | 1 |
| constraint_adherence | 1 |

*The recommendation is fundamentally incorrect: it selects the wrong product family (GDP) for a 150 mm depth requirement and invents non-existent housing lengths and airflow figures. It also fails basic sizing logic (four 300x300 cannot replace one 600x600 at the same face velocity) and provides no relevant engineering warnings or alternatives.*

Strengths: Appropriately asked a clarification question before recommending a product.; Uses a structured product-card format that could be useful if populated with correct data.
Weaknesses: Invents/incorrectly states key catalog specs (length, airflow, corrosion class) and selects an incompatible product family for the requested filter depth.; Fails fundamental HVAC sizing logic: four 300x300 housings cannot deliver 3400 m³/h at comparable face velocity to one 600x600.

### chatgpt_env_marine_gdmi_rf — 3.6 FAIL

**Query:** GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 72.1s

**USER** (turn 1):

| tone | 1 |
| reasoning_quality | 1 |
| constraint_adherence | 5 |

*The system correctly identified that the requested configuration is invalid, as the catalog explicitly states GDMI is not available in RF (Stainless Steel). However, the response is a critical failure in user experience because it provides only a warning tag with absolutely no explanation, reasoning, or alternative recommendations.*

Strengths: Correctly validates material availability against the catalog (GDMI not available in RF).; Prevents invalid product selection.
Weaknesses: Provides no explanation for the rejection.; Fails to suggest valid alternatives (e.g., GDMI in ZM or GDC in RF).; Complete lack of consultative advice.

| correctness | 2 |

| tone | 3 |

| constraint_adherence | 2 |

*The system produced only a generic risk warning and no technical content, so it cannot be verified against the catalog nor assessed for sound engineering. Given the offshore context, it also failed to explicitly confirm/deny suitability and to request key missing parameters (corrosion class, exposure, required airflow, length, sealing/leakage requirements).*

Strengths: Flagged that there is some form of risk (at least did not blindly approve).; Avoided inventing product cards/specs when missing inputs.
Weaknesses: No actionable engineering guidance (no confirmation of RF availability for GDMI, no corrosion-class discussion, no offshore suitability assessment).; Failed to ask essential clarifying questions (airflow, installation location/exposure, required length 600/850, connection type, hygiene/ATEX needs).

### chatgpt_env_pool_gdb_fz — 3.6 FAIL

**Query:** GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 56.6s

**USER** (turn 1):

*The system correctly identified a critical safety risk: galvanized steel (FZ) is unsuitable for the corrosive environment of an indoor swimming pool. However, the response is a FAIL because it provided absolutely no explanation, reasoning, or alternative recommendation (such as Stainless Steel) to the user, failing completely on the 'Consultant' aspect of its role.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that FZ (Galvanized) is unsafe for swimming pool environments.; Prioritizes safety over providing a product card.
Weaknesses: Failed to communicate the reason for the warning.; Failed to suggest the correct material (Stainless Steel/RF) which is available in the catalog.; Provided no value to the user beyond a generic error flag.

*The system produced only a generic risk warning and no technical content, so it cannot be verified against the catalog nor assessed for sound engineering judgment. Given the application (indoor swimming pool), a material suitability discussion (chlorine/corrosion) is essential but was not provided.*

Strengths: Did not fabricate product cards or specifications when uncertain.; Flagged that some risk exists rather than giving an unqualified approval.
Weaknesses: Essential engineering guidance for indoor swimming pool corrosion risk and material selection was missing.; No catalog-backed selection details (length option, airflow capacity, weight, connection options) or clarifying questions were provided.

### hc_gdmi_sf_trap — 3.6 FAIL

**Query:** We require an insulated GDMI housing in Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) for a marine chemical plant (C5-M). Airflow: 3400 m³/h. Please provide the code.
**Category:** material | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 78.1s

*The system correctly identified a hard constraint: the GDMI housing is not available in Stainless Steel (SF) per the catalog. However, the response was effectively empty, providing only a warning tag without any text explanation or alternative recommendation (like ZM). While the logic was safe and factually correct, the complete lack of communication constitutes a failure.*

Strengths: Correctly enforced the 'Ej i Rostfritt' (Not in Stainless) constraint for GDMI housings.; Did not hallucinate a product code for a requested but unavailable configuration.
Weaknesses: Failed to provide any text explanation for the refusal.; Did not suggest the standard ZM material (C5 rated) as a valid alternative.

*The system produced only a generic risk warning and no recommendation or code, so it fails to answer the user’s request. It also missed a key catalog constraint: GDMI FLEX is explicitly “Ej i rostfritt” and standard GDMI material is ZM/AZ, so an SF/316 GDMI request requires clarification/exception handling rather than a silent block.*

Strengths: Did not output an incorrect product code for an apparently non-standard material request.; Flagged that some risk exists for the stated environment.
Weaknesses: No clarification questions or alternative recommendation despite missing/contradictory constraints (GDMI + SF/316).; No product card/code output, making the consultant unusable for the stated task.

### hc_marine_gdmi_sf_pivot — 3.6 FAIL

*The system correctly identified a hard product constraint: the requested GDMI housing is not available in Stainless Steel (SF). However, the response is a complete failure in terms of consulting; it provides a warning label but absolutely no explanation, context, or alternative recommendation. A user receiving this response would not know if the issue was the material, the size, or the application.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies negative constraints (GDMI not available in SF); Does not hallucinate non-existent product variants even when requested
Weaknesses: Total lack of explanation for the rejection; Fails to offer valid alternatives (e.g., GDMI in ZM which is C5 rated)

*The system produced only a generic risk warning and no recommendation or product card, so it fails to address the user’s request. It also appears to block or hesitate without explaining the actual catalog constraint: GDMI is not offered in SF per the provided PDF, while GDMI FLEX explicitly states “Ej i rostfritt.”*

Strengths: Did not fabricate a GDMI-SF product card or specs when the catalog does not support it.; Flagged that there is some risk/issue (at least indicating a potential constraint).
Weaknesses: No explicit explanation of why GDMI-SF cannot be provided per catalog material options, and no alternatives were suggested.; No clarification workflow (required size/airflow/length/connection/door handing) before selection.
