*The system fundamentally failed to interpret the user's request and provided factually incorrect product data. It interpreted the total airflow (3400 m³/h) as the requirement for *each* small 300x300 housing, leading to an absurd recommendation of 7 parallel modules per housing. Additionally, it specified a housing length of 550mm for the GDP family, which is restricted to 250mm in the catalog.*

Strengths: Correctly identified the rated airflow for a single 300x300 module (500 m³/h); Correctly checked for filter depth compatibility
Weaknesses: Hallucinated housing length (550mm) for GDP product family; Catastrophic sizing logic (recommending 7 parallel units for a 300x300 request); Nonsensical airflow calculation in product card (7 * 3400 = 23,800 m³/h); Failed to interpret the user's intent to split total airflow across 4 units

*The system correctly flags that 3400 m³/h cannot be handled by a single 300x300 GDP, but it then produces multiple critical catalog/spec errors (wrong housing length, wrong filter depth coding, wrong airflow math, and wrong weights). It also fails to implement the user’s stated intent of using four 300x300 housings and instead recommends 7 parallel units per housing, which is internally inconsistent and not a viable selection outcome.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that 3400 m³/h exceeds the recommended flow for a single 300x300 GDP module (500 m³/h).; Asks a relevant clarification (filter depth) before finalizing.
Weaknesses: Multiple critical catalog mismatches (GDP length, product code vs 96 mm depth, airflow and weight calculations).; Recommendation is internally inconsistent and does not satisfy the user’s requested 4-housing concept.

### chatgpt_env_marine_gdmi_rf — 4.2 FAIL

**Query:** GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 75.0s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> **Important:** RF (stainless steel) is **not available** for GDMI. Available material options: Aluzink, Zinkmagnesium ZM310. Please select an available material to proceed.
> 
> For the offshore project, I see you've selected a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions.
> 
> However, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. The housing corrosion class is C4.
> 
> Additionally, the RF (Stainless Steel) material is unavailable for the GDMI product family. To proceed, we need to select a different material.
> 
> Available materials for GDMI are Aluzink (C4 corrosion class) and Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (C5 corrosion class). Zinkmagnesium ZM310 offers better corrosion resistance for marine environments.
> 
> To finalize the configuration, I need two details:
> 
> High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.

*The system correctly identifies critical product limitations (no stainless steel for GDMI) and environmental constraints (GDMI is C4, unsuitable for offshore C5). However, the response is functionally broken: it states 'I need two details:' but fails to list them, leaving the user unable to proceed. This is a critical failure in the consultation flow.*

Strengths: Accurate verification of material availability (blocking RF for GDMI); Sound engineering judgment regarding environmental suitability (C4 vs Offshore)
Weaknesses: Critical failure to provide the clarification questions it announced; Irrelevant warning about carbon humidity for a general housing request

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is not offered in stainless (RF) per the catalog and that ZM is the more corrosion-resistant option. However, it contradicts itself by saying GDMI is unsuitable offshore while simultaneously suggesting ZM (C5) as a marine-suitable workaround, and it introduces an irrelevant carbon/humidity warning for a non-carbon housing family.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that GDMI is not available in RF and lists AZ/ZM as options.; Recognizes offshore/marine corrosion as a primary design driver and points toward higher corrosion class material.
Weaknesses: Contradictory offshore guidance (declares GDMI unsuitable for marine, then suggests ZM C5 as a solution) without defining conditions or alternatives (e.g., different housing family/material).; Introduces irrelevant carbon adsorption/humidity warning and leaves the clarification request incomplete (“two details” not specified).

### chatgpt_env_pool_gdb_fz — 5.0 PASS

**Query:** GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 56.7s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> The GDB filter housing in size 600x600mm was specified for an indoor swimming pool application. However, the selected FZ (galvanized steel) material with corrosion class C3 is not suitable for environments with high humidity and chlorine exposure.
> 
> Chlorine exposure requires a minimum corrosion resistance of C5 because the zinc coating (C3) dissolves rapidly in chlorinated environments. Therefore, I cannot recommend the GDB housing in galvanized steel.
> 
> To proceed, I need to select a housing material that is compatible with the swimming pool environment. Here are the available options:
> 
> • Syrafast 1.4404/SS2348 (corrosion class C5.1)
> • Rostfritt 1.4301/SS2333 (corrosion class C5)
> • Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (corrosion class C5)
> • Aluzink (corrosion class C4)
> • Förzinkat Z275 (corrosion class C3)

*The system correctly identifies a critical engineering risk: using galvanized steel (FZ/C3) in a swimming pool environment leads to rapid corrosion. It effectively blocks the unsafe configuration, cites the correct corrosion principles, and offers valid material alternatives listed in the PDF.*

Strengths: Strong engineering judgment regarding environmental suitability; Accurate mapping of PDF material data (Page 4) to the user's request; Clear and actionable alternatives provided

*The system correctly flags that galvanized (FZ) is a poor choice for chlorinated, high-humidity pool environments and appropriately asks for a corrosion-resistant material before recommending a final configuration. However, it misstates the catalog corrosion class for FZ and implies material options for GDB without verifying that GDB is offered in those materials in the provided PDF excerpt.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies chlorinated pool environments as highly corrosive and avoids recommending galvanized steel.; Good clarification flow: asks for material selection before issuing product cards/final recommendation.
Weaknesses: Catalog mismatch on corrosion class: states FZ=C3 for GDB, while GDB section specifies C2 for its standard galvanized execution.; Does not verify/justify that GDB is available in RF/SF/ZM/AZ in this catalog; misses suggesting GDMI (ZM, insulated) as a more appropriate housing type for condensation-prone pool AHU rooms.

**Category:** material | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 74.5s

**USER** (turn 1):
> We require an insulated GDMI housing in Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) for a marine chemical plant (C5-M). Airflow: 3400 m³/h. Please provide the code.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> For the marine chemical plant application, I see that you initially requested a GDMI housing with 600x600mm dimensions and 3400 m³/h airflow.
> 
> However, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. Salt spray accelerates corrosion on the standard galvanized steel (C3) housings. The marine environment requires a housing with C5.1 corrosion resistance.
> 
> Unfortunately, SF (Syrafast Stainless Steel) is not available for the GDMI product family. The available materials for GDMI are Aluzink (C4) and Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (C5). To proceed with the GDMI housing, I need to know which of these materials you would like to use.

*The system provides an excellent response that demonstrates deep product knowledge and sound engineering judgment. It correctly identifies a specific, easy-to-miss constraint in the PDF (GDMI is not available in Stainless Steel) and blocks the user's request for SF material. It correctly infers the housing size (600x600) from the airflow (3400 m³/h) and asks for the necessary missing parameter (filter depth) to determine the housing length.*

Strengths: Caught the specific 'Ej i Rostfritt' (Not in Stainless) constraint on page 11; Correctly inferred dimensions from airflow capacity; Asked for the specific parameter (filter depth) needed to determine housing length

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is an indoor, insulated housing and that SF/316 is not offered for GDMI in this catalog, but it incorrectly claims GDMI is generally unsuitable for marine environments and misstates GDMI’s standard material. It also asks for “filter depth” even though GDMI is a bag/compact filter housing (length selection is the key parameter), and it introduces an irrelevant carbon/humidity warning for a GDMI request.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that SF (syrafast/316) is not available for GDMI in this catalog and asks for an available material choice.; Recognizes the need to consider corrosion class for a marine chemical plant and steers toward higher-resistance materials (e.g., ZM).
Weaknesses: Incorrect claim that GDMI is unsuitable for marine environments and that it is based on standard galvanized steel (C3), conflicting with catalog material positioning for GDMI.; Asks for the wrong missing parameter (filter depth) and adds an irrelevant carbon/humidity warning for a non-carbon housing request.

*The system demonstrated perfect adherence to catalog constraints by correctly identifying that the GDMI housing is not available in Stainless Steel (SF), a specific limitation mentioned in the PDF. It provided sound engineering advice by recommending Zinc Magnesium (ZM310) as the best available alternative for a marine environment, aligning with the C5 corrosion class rating found in the material specifications.*

Strengths: Accurate identification of negative constraints (what the product CANNOT do); Sound material substitution recommendation (ZM for Marine/C5); Correct correlation of corrosion classes (C4/C5) from PDF page 4

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is typically supplied in ZM/AZ and that SF is not offered for GDMI in this catalog, but it then recommends Aluzink (AZ) for a marine ship installation, which is not appropriate for C5 marine exposure. It also fails to propose the correct stainless alternative (RF/SF) by switching to a product family that actually supports it, and it provides no sizing/product card follow-through.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that GDMI is an insulated/double-skin concept and that SF is not offered for GDMI in this catalog.; Calls out key marine environmental stressors (salt spray, humidity, condensation) relevant to corrosion selection.
Weaknesses: Recommends Aluzink (C4) for a marine ship installation where C5/C5.1 is typically required; this undermines the corrosion-resistance guidance.; No actionable product selection: no alternative family in RF/SF, no sizing questions, and no product card output.
