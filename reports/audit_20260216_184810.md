### hc_lcc_four_small_housings — 1.8 FAIL

**Query:** We need 3400 m³/h. Instead of one 600x600 housing, we want four separate 300x300 housings.
**Category:** sizing | **Turns:** 2 | **Product:** yes | **Duration:** 72.3s

**USER** (turn 1):
> We need 3400 m³/h. Instead of one 600x600 housing, we want four separate 300x300 housings.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> To finalize the configuration for each of the four requested GDP housings (300x300mm), I need to know the filter depth to determine the appropriate housing length.
> 
> Additionally, the requested 3400 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 500 for a single 300x300 module. 7 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 800x800 mm module can handle 3556 m³/h.
>
> *Clarification: What is the filter depth for each housing?*
> *Why: The filter depth is needed to determine the appropriate housing length.*

**USER** (turn 2):

*The system fundamentally failed to process the engineering request. It did not divide the total airflow (3400 m³/h) across the four requested housings, instead trying to size *each* 300x300 housing for the full 3400 m³/h, resulting in an absurd recommendation of 7 modules per housing (28 total). Additionally, it mixed up product families: it labeled the product 'GDP' (which has a fixed length of 250mm and max filter depth of 100mm per PDF p.3) but assigned it a length of 550mm to accommodate the user's 150mm depth request (which requires the GDB family).*

Strengths: Correctly identified that a single standard 300x300 module cannot handle 3400 m³/h
Weaknesses: Failed to divide total airflow by the number of units requested (3400/4); Confused GDP (Panel Filter) and GDB (Bag Filter) product families; Hallucinated product dimensions (GDP length 550mm); Recommended 7 parallel units per housing instead of selecting the correct high-capacity product (GDB)

*The system correctly flags that 3400 m³/h cannot be handled by four 300x300 GDP housings, but it then outputs incorrect product codes, impossible housing lengths for GDP, and a nonsensical airflow calculation (23800 m³/h). It also ignores the user’s 150 mm depth request (GDP supports max 100 mm) and duplicates the same item four times while stating 7 units are required.*

Strengths: Appropriately asked for missing parameter (filter depth) before finalizing.; Correctly identified that a single 300x300 GDP module cannot handle 3400 m³/h and estimated ~7 units needed.
Weaknesses: Multiple hard spec violations: wrong GDP length, wrong airflow aggregation, and ignores GDP max filter depth (100 mm).; Output structure is inconsistent (four identical items) and does not deliver a coherent, buildable solution for the requested 3400 m³/h.

### hc_marine_gdmi_sf_pivot — 3.4 FAIL

**Query:** Ship installation. We require insulation and Syrafast stainless (SF). Please provide GDMI-SF.
**Category:** material | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 43.2s

**USER** (turn 1):
> Ship installation. We require insulation and Syrafast stainless (SF). Please provide GDMI-SF.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> The GDMI family is not suitable for marine/offshore environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. The C4 housing corrosion class is insufficient for this application.
> 
> Additionally, outdoor installation exposes the system to outdoor condensation. The GDMI housing is not insulated, which can lead to condensation issues.
> 
> Unfortunately, Syrafast stainless (SF) is not available for the GDMI product family. However, we can offer the GDMI in Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (corrosion class C5) or Aluzink (corrosion class C4).
> 
> Please let me know if you would like to proceed with either of these material options.

*The system correctly blocked the requested material (SF) based on catalog constraints and correctly flagged the corrosion risk for marine environments. However, it committed a critical factual error by stating the GDMI housing is 'not insulated'. The PDF explicitly defines GDMI as the specific product family that *is* factory insulated ('värme- och kondensisolerat'), distinguishing it from the others.*

Strengths: Correctly identified that GDMI is not available in Stainless/Syrafast (SF).; Good engineering judgment regarding corrosion risks in marine environments.
Weaknesses: Critical hallucination: stated GDMI is not insulated, when it is the only factory-insulated option in the catalog.; Incorrectly advised on condensation risk based on the false insulation claim.

*The response correctly challenges GDMI for ship/marine use and flags condensation/corrosion risks, but it contains key catalog inaccuracies about GDMI insulation and available materials (including SF availability). It also fails to propose a viable SF/insulated alternative from the shown carbon/patron families, leaving the user without a workable selection path.*

Strengths: Good risk awareness for marine corrosion and condensation, and it avoids overcommitting without a safe match.; Communicates limitations and asks the user to choose among material options (even though the options are not fully accurate for GDMI).
Weaknesses: Catalog mismatches: GDMI insulation status and stainless/SF availability are misstated, undermining trust.; No alternative recommendation path to meet the stated hard requirements (insulated + SF) and no clarification questions on sizing/airflow.

### hc_gdmi_sf_trap — 5.0 PASS

**Query:** We require an insulated GDMI housing in Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) for a marine chemical plant (C5-M). Airflow: 3400 m³/h. Please provide the code.
**Category:** material | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 56.1s

**USER** (turn 1):
> We require an insulated GDMI housing in Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) for a marine chemical plant (C5-M). Airflow: 3400 m³/h. Please provide the code.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> For the marine chemical plant application, I understand you need a GDMI housing with 3400 m³/h airflow.
> 
> The initial material selection of Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316) is not available for the GDMI product family. This is because GDMI housings are typically C4 corrosion class, and SF requires C5.1 for marine environments where 
> 
> Salt Spray
> 
>  and 
> 
> High Humidity
> 
>  are present. The GDMI housing itself is corrosion class C4.
> 
> Outdoor Condensation
> 
>  is also a concern.
> 
> Available materials for the GDMI housing that meet the C5 requirement are Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (corrosion class C5) and Aluzink (corrosion class C4).

*The system correctly identified a specific product constraint hidden in the text of the PDF (GDMI is not available in stainless steel) and blocked the user's request for 'Syrafast' material. It correctly navigated the contradiction between the general material list and the specific product page constraints. The engineering reasoning regarding corrosion classes and material availability was sound and safe.*

Strengths: Caught the specific 'Ej i Rostfritt' constraint on Page 11 which overrides the general material list.; Correctly identified ZM (Zinc Magnesium) as the valid alternative for higher corrosion resistance.; Did not hallucinate a product code for an invalid configuration.

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is an indoor, insulated housing and that marine chemical plant conditions require high corrosion resistance, but it makes incorrect catalog claims about GDMI material availability and fails to provide a viable code/alternative selection. It also contradicts itself by implying ZM/AZ are available for GDMI while stating SF is not, without verifying the catalog’s stated standard material for GDMI.*

Strengths: Correctly treats C5-M marine chemical environment as a high-corrosion-risk case and avoids blindly accepting galvanized solutions.; Flags condensation/outdoor exposure as a relevant engineering risk for insulated vs non-insulated housings.
Weaknesses: Material availability guidance is inconsistent with the PDF (GDMI standard material and example code), undermining trust in the recommendation.; Fails to deliver the primary user need (a specific order code) or propose a correct alternative product family that can be supplied in SF/316.
