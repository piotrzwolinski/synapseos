The PDF consistently provides two weight variants (Short/Long housing) for GDB, GDC, and GDMI families, but the graph typically only stores the 'Short' weight. Furthermore, the weights for the largest GDMI sizes (2400mm width) in the graph do not match the PDF at all, indicating a calculation error or bad data source.\n\nMaterial availability for the GDMI range needs review, as the graph includes materials (FZ, AZ) that the PDF implies are replaced by ZM. Finally, specific attribute data such as cartridge counts for smaller/irregular sizes and airflow ratings for PFF frames are missing from the graph nodes."

However, there are critical structural issues in how the graph models length-dependent data and cartridge configurations, and these issues propagate into many incorrect or incomplete facts.\n\nThe most severe problems are: (1) length variants are simplified (e.g., 550 vs 550/600; 750 vs 750/800; 900 vs 900/950; 1100 vs 1100/1150), (2) weights are largely incorrect because the PDF provides two weight columns per length and the graph stores only one—and many stored weights match neither column (especially for GDB and GDMI), and (3) cartridge counts are only partially modeled, missing most rows for GDC/GDC FLEX/GDMI FLEX. Additionally, GDMI appears to be missing at least some size rows from the PDF (e.g., 1800x2400 and 2100x2400), and several option/compatibility dependencies (polisfilter and 600 mm cylinders) are not encoded, risking invalid configurations."

The most critical problems are in weight data: GDB weights are systematically wrong (appearing to be roughly half the correct PDF values for many sizes), and GDMI weights have numerous discrepancies compared to the PDF page 12 table. Nearly all product families that have two length variants (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) only store one weight value in the graph when the PDF provides weights for both lengths.\n\nProduct completeness is partially addressed — all 12 product families from the PDF exist in the graph. However, GDMI is missing 3 sizes (1800x2400, 2100x2400, 2400x2400) while incorrectly including 2 sizes not in the PDF (1200x2100, 1500x2100). Cartridge counts for GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX are only stored for 2 sizes each when the PDF specifies counts for all sizes. Accessory products (BFF, PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil) lack DimensionModule data entirely.\n\nMaterial availability is generally correct for the main housing families but is missing for accessories (BFF, PFF, PT, EXL). Length variants consistently omit the flange-connection length (e.g., storing '550' instead of '550/600'). The overall score of 52 reflects that while the graph structure is sound and product families are present, the numeric data accuracy — which is critical for product selection and engineering — has widespread errors that would lead to incorrect recommendations."

Material availability for GDMI and GDMI FLEX is largely supported by the catalog icons, but the graph must clearly separate 'available materials' from 'typical/default manufacture' to reconcile text (\"vanligen i ZM\") with ordering examples (often AZ or even FZ). Cartridge cabinet semantics also require correction: constraints like polisfilter applicability are tied to specific long housing lengths, and cartridge 'max length' should be modeled as cylinder length options rather than generic 'filter depth'. Overall, correcting variant modeling (length, weight-by-length, options-by-length) remains the highest-impact remediation."

The most critical problem is weight data accuracy: GDB weights are systematically wrong (approximately 50% of correct values) across nearly all sizes, affecting 25+ entries. GDMI and GDC weights also show discrepancies, though less severe. All three evaluators agree that the graph fails to store dual weight values for products with two length variants (GDB 550/600 vs 750/800, GDMI 600/650 vs 850/900, GDC 750/800 vs 900/950, etc.). Length variants themselves are stored as single values (e.g., 550) rather than the paired format shown in the PDF (550/600), which all evaluators flagged. Material availability is generally correct, though the GDMI default material question (AZ vs ZM) needs clarification - the PDF examples use AZ while text says ZM is typical. The corrosion class discrepancy (C2 product vs C3 material for FZ-based products) raised by openai is actually a valid PDF representation rather than a graph error. Missing data includes PFF airflow ratings, complete cartridge counts for GDC, and filter module breakdowns. The graph's structural modeling of product families, dimension options, and connection types appears sound, but the underlying numerical data requires a comprehensive re-import and validation pass. I lower the consensus score to 48 reflecting the pervasive weight data errors that would impact any engineering calculations relying on this data."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph has fundamental data integrity issues that render it unreliable for engineering calculations, product selection, and order configuration. The most severe problem is weight data: GDB weights are systematically wrong across nearly all 27 sizes (values appear to be roughly 50% of correct PDF values), GDMI weights have numerous discrepancies across its 37 sizes, and GDC/GDMI FLEX weights also contain errors. Compounding this, the graph stores only one weight per size when the PDF consistently provides two weights (one per length variant) for all multi-length families (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX). This structural deficiency means that even where one weight is correct, the alternate-length weight is entirely missing.\n\nLength variants themselves are systematically simplified — the graph stores single values (e.g., 550, 750) where the PDF specifies paired PG/flange variants (550/600, 750/800). This affects all five multi-length product families. The GDMI family has additional size inventory errors: three valid sizes are missing (1800x2400, 2100x2400, 2400x2400) while two phantom sizes not in the PDF are present (1200x2100, 1500x2100). Cartridge counts for the three patron filter families (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) are only populated for 2 sizes each despite the PDF providing counts for all sizes. Accessory products (BFF, PT, TT, EXL) lack DimensionModule data entirely.\n\nThe graph's structural modeling of product families and basic categorization is sound — all 12 product families from the PDF are represented, and material availability for the main housing families is largely correct. However, the pervasive numerical data errors, missing variant-dependent data, and incomplete accessory product information mean the graph cannot be trusted for downstream applications without a comprehensive data re-import and validation effort. The consensus score of 42 reflects that while the graph skeleton is reasonable, the underlying data that engineers and configurators would rely upon is substantially compromised."
