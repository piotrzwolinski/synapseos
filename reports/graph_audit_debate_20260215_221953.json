All product families from the PDF table of contents are present in the graph. The vast majority of dimensional data (sizes, weights, airflows, cartridge counts, module breakdowns) has been accurately transcribed from the PDF tables. The graph correctly captures the full range of sizes for each family, including the large GDMI range up to 2400x2400.\n\nThe most significant issues found are: (1) GDMI FLEX material availability - the graph includes FZ as available but the PDF material icons only show AZ and ZM, creating a conflict with the example code which uses FZ; (2) The GDB 600x900 module breakdown appears to have the ¼ and ½ module counts swapped compared to the PDF; (3) The GDB 1800x900 short weight of 36 kg is correctly flagged as a suspected PDF error; (4) The GDMI FLEX weight column header duplication is properly documented as a source conflict. Several source conflicts between PDF text and PDF tables (particularly for GDMI lengths and default materials) are well-documented in the graph.\n\nOverall, the graph achieves approximately 72/100 in accuracy. The deductions are primarily for the material availability discrepancy on GDMI FLEX, the module breakdown error on GDB 600x900, some minor formatting inconsistencies (float vs integer airflow values), and the lack of explicit material exclusion documentation on some families. The graph's practice of documenting SOURCE_CONFLICTs where the PDF itself is inconsistent is commendable and adds significant value for downstream consumers."

I retract my finding #1 (GDMI FLEX FZ availability) as page 18 does show FZ as an icon, and finding #4 (EXL materials) as page 23 clearly shows four material icons supporting the graph's data. The Gemini evaluator's finding #3 about EXL materials is incorrect - the icons are clearly present on page 23.

    "summary": "The knowledge graph demonstrates strong overall fidelity to the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC Filterskåp PDF catalog (Version 01-09-2025). All 12 product families are correctly represented, and the vast majority of dimensional data—including sizes, weights, airflows, cartridge counts, and module breakdowns across hundreds of table rows—has been accurately transcribed. The graph's practice of documenting SOURCE_CONFLICTs where the PDF itself contains internal inconsistencies (e.g., GDMI text vs. table lengths, GDMI FLEX weight column headers) is commendable and adds significant value for downstream data consumers.\n\nThe most significant issues identified fall into three categories: (1) Material availability precision—several product families have materials listed that are not supported by the page-level material icons (e.g., RF on PT/TT, SF on EXL) or are missing explicit exclusions (RF/SF on GDMI/GDMI FLEX); (2) Non-PDF-sourced data contamination—chlorine PPM values have no basis in the catalog and risk generating incorrect engineering recommendations; and (3) Isolated dimensional discrepancies—the GDC FLEX size label/column mismatch and the GDB 600x900 module breakdown error require correction. Additionally, the graph introduces option codes (e.g., 'PF' for polisfilter) that have no PDF backing and should be removed or re-tagged.\n\nOnce the material availability enforcement is tightened to match each product page's icon row exactly, the chlorine PPM data is segregated, and the handful of dimensional corrections are applied, the graph would achieve an estimated accuracy in the mid-to-high 80s. The foundation is solid and the data quality management approach (SOURCE_CONFLICT flags, SUSPECTED_PDF_ERROR annotations) is well-designed for a living catalog system."
