Several other issues are schema/normalization problems (code format tokenization, PT vs PTT aliasing, non-PDF chlorine ppm enrichment) that should be addressed to keep the KG strictly aligned with the PDF as source-of-truth while still allowing external enrichments with explicit provenance."

All product families from the table of contents are present, and the vast majority of dimensional data, airflow ratings, weight values, cartridge counts, and material availability specifications match the PDF source of truth. The size tables for GDP (34 sizes), GDB (27 sizes), GDMI (35 sizes including large 2400x2400 variants), GDC (12 sizes), GDC FLEX (6 sizes), GDMI FLEX (8 sizes), BFF (5 sizes), PFF (25 sizes), TT (35 sizes), PT (5 sizes), EXL (8 sizes), and Filter Profil (12 widths × 3 depths) are all complete and accurate.\n\nThe most notable discrepancies found are: (1) GDB 600x900 has incorrect module breakdown (¼ and ½ modules swapped), (2) the GDMI FLEX weight column labeling references '900' instead of '1100/1150', (3) the PFF construction type is listed as 'BOLTED' with a pending verification note rather than reflecting the actual punched mesh construction described in the PDF, (4) the GDMI FLEX long variant description may inaccurately describe the polisfilter configuration, and (5) several construction details like hinge types, lock types, and standard features (e.g., GDP's filter rail with spring) are not captured in the graph.\n\nThe material availability across families is well-represented, correctly reflecting that GDMI and GDMI FLEX exclude stainless steel (RF/SF) options, while most other families support all five materials. Corrosion class assignments are consistent between the graph and PDF. The code format templates generally match the PDF examples, though they could be enhanced to explicitly show variable fields for hinge direction and connection type options. Overall, the graph is a solid representation of the catalog with only minor corrections needed."

I retract my earlier claim that GDMI is available in stainless (RF) because the GDMI FLEX page explicitly states \"Ej i rostfritt\" and the GDMI page text likewise indicates not stainless; the header icons for GDMI also only show AZ/ZM. The remaining concerns stand: the graph should distinguish 'standard orderable' vs 'on request' materials (especially for PT and frames), avoid non-PDF enrichment being treated as PDF-verified (chlorine ppm), and enforce option dependencies (polisfilter rail requires the longer GDC/GDC FLEX/GDMI FLEX length variants)."

The OpenAI evaluator's finding about GDMI needing RF material is incorrect - the PDF explicitly excludes stainless steel for GDMI ('Ej i Rostfritt'). Similarly, the code format findings for EXL and Filter Profil are incorrect as the graph matches the PDF's actual formatting. Material availability for BFF is correctly represented in the graph since the PDF shows all five material icons. The GDMI FLEX weight table has a header error in the PDF itself (both columns labeled 1100/1150) which needs careful handling. The internal PDF inconsistency for GDMI lengths (text says 550/600 vs table says 600/650) is correctly resolved by the graph following the dimension table. Overall, the graph needs targeted corrections primarily in module counts, construction metadata, configuration dependency rules, and removal of unverified enrichment data."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph provides a solid structural representation of the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC filter cabinet catalog, with all 12 product families present and the vast majority of dimensional data, airflow ratings, weight values, and size counts accurately captured. The GDP (34 sizes), GDB (27 sizes), GDMI (35 sizes up to 2400x2400), GDC (12 sizes), GDC FLEX (6 sizes), GDMI FLEX (8 sizes), BFF (5 sizes), PFF (25 sizes), and accessory families are all complete with matching numerical data in most cases.\n\nThe most significant issues fall into three categories: (1) concrete data errors, most notably the GDB 600x900 module count swap (¼ vs ½) and the GDMI FLEX weight column mislabeling; (2) metadata integrity problems, including unverified chlorine PPM enrichment data not present in the PDF, incorrect PFF construction type (BOLTED vs actual stamped mesh), and GDMI FLEX service access misclassification; and (3) missing configuration logic, particularly the absence of dependency rules tying polisfilter rail options to specific longer cabinet lengths across GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX families.\n\nMaterial availability is generally well-represented, with the graph correctly excluding stainless steel (RF/SF) from GDMI and GDMI FLEX as stated in the PDF. However, the distinction between 'standard orderable' and 'on-request' materials needs improvement for PT and TT families where only FZ appears in the standard size tables. The code format templates should be updated to reflect variable fields (hinge direction, connection type) rather than hardcoding standard values. Overall, the graph requires targeted corrections rather than fundamental restructuring, with the highest priority being the data accuracy fixes and the addition of configuration dependency rules."
