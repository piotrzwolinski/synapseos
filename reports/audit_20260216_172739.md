*The system fundamentally failed the sizing logic. It interpreted the total airflow (3400 m³/h) as applying to *each* of the four requested housings (or failed to split it), leading it to recommend '7 parallel units' for a '300x300 housing'. This is physically impossible, as a 300x300 housing is a single module. Furthermore, the JSON output contains a massive calculation error, listing rated airflow as 23,800 m³/h.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies the rated flow of a single GDP 300x300 module (500 m³/h) from the PDF.; Correctly identifies the weight of a single module (7 kg).
Weaknesses: Failed to split total airflow across the four units (3400 / 4 = 850 m³/h).; Proposed a physically impossible configuration (7 modules inside a single-module 300x300 size).; Hallucinated airflow values in the final JSON (23800 m³/h).

*The system correctly flags that a single 300x300 GDP cannot handle 3400 m³/h, but it then produces multiple critical catalog/spec errors (wrong housing length, wrong airflow math, and wrong filter depth handling), resulting in an invalid and misleading final product card. The recommendation also ignores the user’s stated intent (four housings) and instead implies 7 parallel units per housing without a coherent system layout.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that 3400 m³/h exceeds the recommended flow for a single GDP 300x300 and estimates ~7 parallel units based on 500 m³/h/module.; Asks for a missing parameter (filter depth) before finalizing the configuration.
Weaknesses: Multiple critical catalog mismatches: GDP length, filter depth coding, and weight/airflow figures are incorrect or invented.; Final recommendation is internally inconsistent and does not satisfy the user’s requested architecture (four separate housings).

### chatgpt_env_marine_gdmi_rf — 4.7 PASS

**Query:** GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 86.1s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> For the offshore project, you've selected a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions. However, I need to clarify a few points to ensure the configuration meets the environmental demands and finalize the selection.
> 
> First, standard GDMI housings are C4-rated and designed for indoor use only. Given the marine/offshore environment, the system is exposed to high humidity and salt spray, which requires C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. The GDMI housing is not suitable for outdoor installation due to the risk of outdoor condensation.
> 
> Second, the RF (Stainless Steel) material you requested is not available for the GDMI product line. Acceptable materials are Aluzink (AZ) and ZinkMagnesium (ZM).

*The system correctly identifies two critical blockers: the GDMI housing is not available in Stainless Steel (RF) and is not suitable for offshore/outdoor environments. It accurately cites the PDF constraints ('Ej i Rostfritt', 'Inomhusbruk') and applies sound engineering judgment regarding corrosion classes, although 'C5.1' appears to be a minor OCR typo for 'C5.I'.*

Strengths: Correctly identified that GDMI is not available in Stainless Steel (RF) per PDF page 11.; Correctly distinguished that while ZM material is C5 (p.4), the GDMI housing itself is C4 (p.11).; Properly blocked an indoor housing for an offshore application.
Weaknesses: Refers to corrosion class 'C5.1', which is likely an OCR error for 'C5.I' found in the PDF.; Cites 'risk of outdoor condensation' as the reason for indoor-only restriction; while true for uninsulated units, GDMI is insulated, so rain ingress/IP rating is the more technically accurate reason for the restriction.

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is intended for indoor use and that offshore/marine exposure drives a higher corrosion requirement, but it makes a critical catalog error by claiming RF stainless is not available for GDMI. It also stops short of proposing a viable alternative (e.g., ZM or SF/RF execution if available) and does not ask the key clarifying questions needed to complete a selection.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies offshore/marine exposure as a high-corrosion-risk environment and flags suitability concerns for an indoor housing.; Maintains a clear, professional structure and communicates the key risk (condensation/outdoor exposure) effectively.
Weaknesses: Material availability claim for GDMI (RF not available) is not reliably supported by the provided catalog excerpts and appears inconsistent with the catalog’s general material options vs. product-specific notes.; Fails to progress the selection by asking for essential design inputs (airflow, installation location, chemical exposure) and by not proposing a compliant alternative product/material configuration.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):

*The system correctly identifies a critical product limitation: the GDMI housing cannot be manufactured in the requested acid-proof stainless steel (SF). It correctly cites the corrosion class (C4) and requests necessary sizing information. The advice is safe and technically sound.*

Strengths: Accurate verification of material limitations (No SF for GDMI); Correct identification of corrosion class (C4); Good clarification flow
Weaknesses: Assumed carbon filtration intent (humidity warning) without user specification

*The system correctly challenged the requested GDMI-SF configuration, but it made a critical catalog error by stating GDMI is only available in AZ and ZM (the catalog also lists RF/SF as general material options and explicitly states GDMI can be made in stainless). It also asked for several parameters that are not necessary to answer the immediate feasibility question (SF availability) and introduced an irrelevant carbon/humidity warning for a GDMI particulate housing.*

Strengths: Correctly treats marine/offshore as a high-corrosion-risk environment and pauses for clarification before final selection.; Maintains a professional technical-sales tone and avoids overcommitting with product cards.
Weaknesses: Critical product-data inconsistency: asserts GDMI cannot be supplied in SF, which is not supported by the provided catalog excerpts and conflicts with the catalog’s general material offering.; Introduces irrelevant carbon/humidity performance warning for a GDMI particulate filter housing, reducing technical credibility.

### chatgpt_env_pool_gdb_fz — 5.0 PASS

**Query:** GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 38.6s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> The GDB filter housing in a swimming pool environment is exposed to high humidity and chlorine. The standard galvanized steel (FZ) is not suitable for chlorine environments, as it provides only C3 corrosion resistance. Chlorine exposure requires a minimum of C5 corrosion resistance to prevent rapid corrosion.

> To proceed with the correct material, I need to know the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?

*The system correctly identified a critical material incompatibility. Recommending galvanized steel (FZ) for a swimming pool environment would lead to rapid corrosion; the system rightly blocked this and requested clarification to determine the necessary corrosion resistance (likely leading to Stainless/Acid-proof). This demonstrates excellent engineering judgment and safety awareness.*

Strengths: Strong engineering knowledge regarding corrosion classes in swimming pool environments; Correctly prioritizes safety over simply fulfilling a catalog lookup; Accurate use of PDF material data (FZ = C3)

*The system correctly flags that a swimming pool environment (high humidity + chloramines) is aggressive for standard galvanized housings and appropriately warns against using FZ. However, it misstates the corrosion class of FZ as C3 in this context and asks for chlorine ppm, which is not the most relevant parameter for air-side pool corrosion; it should instead steer toward ZM or stainless and ask about placement/condensation and cleaning regime.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies swimming pool environments as high-corrosion risk and warns against standard galvanized execution.; Uses a clarification question before recommending a final product/material, consistent with the intended flow.
Weaknesses: Corrosion-class statement is inconsistent with the catalog (FZ described as C3 on material page, while product sections describe typical execution as C2), and the ppm question is not the best discriminator for pool air corrosion.; No concrete alternative recommendation (e.g., specify ZM or stainless option, or suggest GDMI if condensation/thermal bridging is a concern).

*The system correctly identified a critical catalog constraint: the GDMI housing is not available in Stainless Steel (SF), despite SF being listed in the general material section. It correctly prioritized the specific product page data over general data. The engineering reasoning regarding corrosion classes (C4 vs C5-M) was sound, and the refusal to generate a code for an unavailable configuration was the correct safety behavior.*

Strengths: Accurate detection of negative constraints ('Ej i Rostfritt') in the catalog; Correct application of corrosion class ratings (C4 for housing vs C5 for material); Proper refusal to hallucinate a product code for an unavailable configuration

*The system correctly blocks SF/316 for GDMI per the catalog and appropriately flags marine corrosion/condensation risks, but it fails to provide the requested housing code using an available material and does not ask for the key missing parameter (size W×H). It also makes a questionable claim that the housing itself is C4 while simultaneously stating GDMI is for indoor use, without clearly resolving suitability for a marine chemical plant installation.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies and enforces the hard catalog constraint: no SF/316 option for GDMI.; Raises relevant corrosion/condensation considerations for marine environments and avoids recommending FZ for salt-spray exposure.
Weaknesses: Fails to progress to a valid alternative configuration/code (e.g., ZM or AZ) despite having airflow and a clear target family (GDMI).; Asks for ambient temperature instead of the critical missing parameters needed to generate the code (W×H size, length, connection type, handing).
