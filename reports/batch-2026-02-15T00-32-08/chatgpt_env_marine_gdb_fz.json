However, this configuration is blocked.The marine environment introduces several stressors. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of C3-rated materials like galvanized steel. Outdoor condensation can form on the housing's C2-rated surfaces, and high humidity will further accelerate corrosion.The GDB family's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Therefore, it's not rated for ENV_MARINE installation (only ENV_INDOOR or ENV_ATEX).Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation with a construction type that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment, while also providing adequate corrosion resistance for the stressors present.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the configuration, I need two details to address the outdoor condensation risk:",
