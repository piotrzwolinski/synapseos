      "content": "This GDB-600x600-FZ filter housing is for a wastewater ventilation application.However, this configuration is BLOCKED. The wastewater treatment environment exposes the system to Chemical Vapor Exposure and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion. Hydrogen sulfide aggressively attacks zinc coatings, and the housing corrosion class is C2. The FZ (C3 galvanized) material corrodes rapidly in such environments. Furthermore, the bolted construction of the GDB housing does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for wastewater environments.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation and use a construction type that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
