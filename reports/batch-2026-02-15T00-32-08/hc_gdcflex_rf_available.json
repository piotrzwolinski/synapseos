The system is exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure from the cleanroom environment, Outdoor Condensation due to the rooftop location, and stringent Hygiene Requirements.The GDC_FLEX filter, with its bolted construction and C2 corrosion class, does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for pharmaceutical environments. This configuration is therefore BLOCKED. Additionally, the GDC_FLEX uses carbon adsorption, which is ineffective against particulate matter, and lacks the thermal insulation needed to prevent condensation in outdoor settings.To address these issues, I recommend a two-stage filtration system. This assembly includes a GDP Planfilterskåp for mechanical filtration to capture particulates and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp for carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors. The GDMI is approved for pharmaceutical environments.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",
