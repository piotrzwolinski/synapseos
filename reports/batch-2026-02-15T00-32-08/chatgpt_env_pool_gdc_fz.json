This environment exposes the system to both High Humidity and Chlorine Exposure.The GDC housing has a C2 corrosion class. The zinc coating (C3) of the FZ material is not suitable for environments with Chlorine Exposure, as it will dissolve within months. High humidity will also accelerate the corrosion of the zinc.The requested configuration is BLOCKED. The product is not rated for ENV_POOL installation and the material tolerates max 0ppm chlorine, but the environment has ~200ppm.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need a material that tolerates chlorine and is rated for pool environments. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the configuration, I need to know the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm).",
