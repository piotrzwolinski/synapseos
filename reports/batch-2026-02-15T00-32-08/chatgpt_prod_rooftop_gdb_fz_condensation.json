      "content": "For the rooftop exhaust application, the GDB housing is not suitable for outdoor installation due to condensation and high humidity concerns. Outdoor Condensation can cause condensation on the housing's C2-rated galvanized steel (FZ) surface, while High Humidity can accelerate corrosion. The GDB's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments.Therefore, the GDB-600x600-R-PG-FZ is blocked for this project. No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation with a welded construction to meet leakage and hygiene requirements, and have thermal insulation to prevent condensation.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements. In the meantime, we can explore options from the GDMI FLEX family, which is better suited for outdoor conditions. To proceed with a GDMI FLEX configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
