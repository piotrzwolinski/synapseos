Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for the marine chemical plant application is blocked. The GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Additionally, the GDMI housing has a C4 corrosion class, while marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. The presence of salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, causing C3-rated materials to fail prematurely. High humidity will also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing the service life of the housing. Finally, outdoor installation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need a fully-welded construction and C5.1-rated materials. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the GDP protector stage, I need to know the filter depth for the 600x600 module. Also, what are the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site? This information is needed to assess the risk of outdoor condensation.",
