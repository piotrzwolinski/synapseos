Please select an available material to proceed.For the outdoor data center intake, the GDMI filter housing cannot be configured with stainless steel (RF). The GDMI family is only available in Aluzink (AZ) or Zinkmagnesium (ZM).Additionally, the selected GDMI filter housing is not rated for outdoor installation due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. This means the current configuration is blocked.Outdoor installations expose the system to high humidity and outdoor condensation. High humidity can accelerate zinc corrosion, potentially reducing the service life of the housing. Outdoor condensation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.To proceed, we would need to explore custom engineering options that meet the requirements for outdoor installation and material compatibility. These options would need to include a welded construction to ensure proper sealing and hygiene, as well as a material suitable for outdoor conditions.To assess the risk of condensation, I need two details about the installation site:",
