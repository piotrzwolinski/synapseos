Please select an available material to proceed.For the offshore project, I see you've selected a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions. Unfortunately, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to its C3 corrosion resistance rating. Salt spray and high humidity accelerate corrosion on the zinc-coated steel, leading to premature failure.Additionally, the RF (Stainless Steel) material is unavailable for the GDMI product family. Available materials are Aluzink AZ185 (C4) and Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (C5).This configuration is blocked because it does not meet the minimum corrosion resistance requirements for a marine environment. The bolted construction of the GDMI also does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.To proceed, we need to consider a solution that provides adequate corrosion protection. Since no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously, I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements: a C5.1 corrosion resistance rating and a fully-welded housing construction.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:",
