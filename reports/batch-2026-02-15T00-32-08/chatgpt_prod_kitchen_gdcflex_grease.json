However, commercial kitchens also involve Grease/Oil Exposure. To protect the carbon filter stage from grease contamination, a two-stage filtration system is required. The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp mechanical pre-filter, and the second stage will be the GDC_FLEX carbon filter. Both housings will be made of RF (stainless steel) with C2 corrosion class.For the GDC_FLEX family, the required airflow of 2500 m³/h exceeds the capacity of a single 600x600 module (1750 m³/h). Therefore, we will use a single 1200x600 module with a total capacity of 3500 m³/h. To finalize the configuration, I need to know the housing length for both stages.",
