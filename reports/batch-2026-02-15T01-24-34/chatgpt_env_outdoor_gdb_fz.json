The GDB housing uses bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. This can lead to water ingress and corrosion.Additionally, outdoor installation exposes the system to High Humidity and Outdoor Condensation. High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency, while condensation on the non-insulated C2 housing can cause corrosion. To ensure proper performance and longevity, a double-wall insulated housing is required to prevent condensation. Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
