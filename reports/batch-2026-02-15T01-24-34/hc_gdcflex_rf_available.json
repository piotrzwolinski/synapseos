      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC_FLEX filter housing is unsuitable due to several factors. The system will be exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure from the cleanroom environment, requiring both mechanical and chemical filtration. The GDC_FLEX only provides chemical filtration. Additionally, the rooftop location introduces Outdoor Condensation, which requires a double-wall insulated housing to prevent condensation. Finally, Hygiene Requirements for pharmaceutical applications recommend C5 corrosion resistance, while the GDC_FLEX housing has a C2 corrosion class.The GDC_FLEX is also BLOCKED because its bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for pharmaceutical environments. The GDMI Modulfilterskåp is approved for pharmaceutical environments and offers a suitable alternative.To provide a complete filtration solution, I recommend a two-stage assembly: a GDP Planfilterskåp for mechanical filtration to protect the GDMI Modulfilterskåp which handles chemical vapor exposure. Both stages will use the 600x600mm dimensions you provided.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:",

The system will be exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure from the cleanroom environment, requiring both mechanical and chemical filtration. The GDC_FLEX only provides chemical filtration. Additionally, the rooftop location introduces Outdoor Condensation, which requires a double-wall insulated housing to prevent condensation. Finally, Hygiene Requirements for pharmaceutical applications recommend C5 corrosion resistance, while the GDC_FLEX housing has a C2 corrosion class."
