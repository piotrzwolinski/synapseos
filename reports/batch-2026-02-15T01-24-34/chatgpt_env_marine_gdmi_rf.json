Please select an available material to proceed.For the offshore project, I see you've selected a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions. Unfortunately, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to its C3 corrosion resistance rating. Salt spray and high humidity will accelerate corrosion on the housing.Additionally, the selected RF (Stainless Steel) material is unavailable for the GDMI product family. Available materials are Aluzink AZ185 (C4) and Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (C5).This configuration is blocked because the GDMI housing's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless).No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a construction type suitable for marine environments. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.I also need to know the airflow for both stages and the filter depth for the GDMI stage to proceed with the configuration.To finalize the configuration:",
