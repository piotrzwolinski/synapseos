Standard activated carbon filters, such as those used in the GDC family, are insufficient for capturing formaldehyde due to its low molecular weight. Effective removal requires impregnated or chemisorption media.Therefore, the GDC family is not suitable for this application.To properly configure a solution, I need to know the housing length required.Which housing length do you need?",
