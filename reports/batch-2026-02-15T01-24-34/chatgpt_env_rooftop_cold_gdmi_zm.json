The GDMI family is designed for indoor use only, and its bolted construction does not meet the leakage and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. Furthermore, outdoor installation exposes the system to high humidity and condensation. Specifically, outdoor condensation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. A double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point. The housing corrosion class is C4.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements for outdoor use.
