The system has detected two environmental stressors: Chemical Vapor Exposure and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion.The selected GDB housing with FZ (C3 galvanized) material is not suitable for environments with H2S, as it will corrode rapidly. Additionally, the GDB's mechanical filters cannot capture gas-phase contaminants from Chemical Vapor Exposure.Furthermore, the product is not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation (allowed: ENV_INDOOR, ENV_ATEX). This product uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To address these issues, a solution would need to:1. Be constructed from a material with a corrosion class of C5 or higher to withstand H2S corrosion.2. Incorporate activated carbon adsorption to remove gas-phase contaminants from Chemical Vapor Exposure.3. Meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for ENV_WASTEWATER installation.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
