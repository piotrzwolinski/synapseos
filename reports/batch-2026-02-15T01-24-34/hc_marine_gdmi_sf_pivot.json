      "content": "This marine/offshore installation is subject to Salt Spray, Outdoor Condensation, and High Humidity. Salt spray accelerates corrosion, high humidity reduces service life, and outdoor condensation can form on non-insulated surfaces.Unfortunately, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to its C3 corrosion resistance rating. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. The bolted construction of the GDMI housing does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Additionally, SF (Syrafast Rostfri Stålplåt / Acid-proof Stainless Steel) is not available for the GDMI product family. Available materials are Aluzink AZ185 and Zinkmagnesium ZM310.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a welded construction to meet leakage and hygiene requirements. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with specifying the GDP protector stage, I need two details:What are the filter dimensions for the GDP protector stage?What is the required airflow?",
