      "content": "For the rooftop exhaust application, the GDB housing with galvanized steel (FZ) is not suitable for outdoor installation due to the risk of condensation and corrosion from high humidity. Outdoor Condensation will cause condensation on the housing's C2-rated surfaces, and High Humidity will accelerate corrosion of the galvanized steel.The GDB series uses bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation (ENV_OUTDOOR) and use a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.As an alternative, the GDMI FLEX series is suitable for outdoor use. To proceed with a GDMI FLEX configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
