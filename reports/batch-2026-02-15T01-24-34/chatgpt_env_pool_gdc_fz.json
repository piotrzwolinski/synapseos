      "content": "This GDC filter configuration is for air recirculation in a swimming pool environment. This application exposes the system to both High Humidity and Chlorine Exposure.The GDC family is not suitable for this environment due to the FZ (C3) zinc coating, which dissolves in chlorinated environments within months. The housing itself has corrosion class C2. Therefore, this configuration is BLOCKED. The material tolerates max 0ppm chlorine, but the environment has ~200ppm. Additionally, this product uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for a pool environment.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to have a material that tolerates chlorine exposure and be rated for a pool environment. Because no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously, I recommend contacting the manufacturer's Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a multi-stage assembly, I need to know the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm). Also, what is the airflow for the GDP protector stage and the GDC target stage? Finally, what is the filter depth for the GDC target stage?",
