      "content": "For the hospital kitchen exhaust system, the selected GDC_FLEX unit is not suitable for the marine environment due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. The housing corrosion class is C2.Additionally, the requested airflow of 3000 m³/h exceeds the maximum capacity of 1750 m³/h for a single 600x600 module. To handle the required airflow, we need to use two modules in parallel, resulting in a 1200x600mm effective housing dimension.This rooftop kitchen application also exposes the system to several stressors:•\tHigh Humidity: Reduces carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerates zinc corrosion.•\tChemical Vapor Exposure: Requires activated carbon adsorption to remove gases, odors, and VOCs.•\tOutdoor Condensation: Can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces, requiring a double-wall insulated housing.•\tGrease/Oil Exposure: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption, necessitating a grease separator upstream.•\tSalt Spray: Accelerates zinc corrosion, requiring C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.•\tHygiene Requirements: Recommends C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) for hygienic surfaces.Given these constraints, no standard catalog product can simultaneously satisfy all requirements. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation, use a construction type that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment, and handle the required airflow. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
