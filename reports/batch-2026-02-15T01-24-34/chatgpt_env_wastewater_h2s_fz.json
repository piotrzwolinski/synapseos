Additionally, the system will be exposed to Chemical Vapor Exposure, which requires activated carbon adsorption to remove gases, and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion, which aggressively attacks the C2 (housing) / C3 (FZ material) zinc coatings, leading to rapid corrosion.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To address these issues, a solution would need to be constructed with fully-welded seams and be made of stainless steel (RF) or acid-proof stainless steel (SF) to withstand the corrosive environment. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
