      "content": "For the cruise ship exhaust application, you've specified a GDC-600x600 filter housing with RF (stainless steel) material. The system is exposed to Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray.Unfortunately, this configuration is blocked. The GDC housing is not rated for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which doesn't meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine applications. Additionally, the housing has a C2 corrosion class, which is insufficient for the salt spray environment, as it accelerates corrosion of the zinc components.The requested airflow of 2600 m³/h also exceeds the maximum capacity of 2000 m³/h for a single 600x600 module. To handle the required airflow, we need to use a larger housing size.Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for marine environments (ENV_MARINE) and handle the specified airflow. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the configuration of the protector stage, I need to know the filter depth for the GDP filter.To finalize the configuration, I also need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site to assess the risk of condensation.",
