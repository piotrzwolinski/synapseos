This configuration is suitable for indoor use.However, the selected 1200x1200mm module has a capacity of 8000 m³/h, while your required airflow is only 800 m³/h. This extreme oversizing can lead to low face velocity and uneven air distribution, reducing efficiency. I recommend a smaller module size for better performance.Also, since your application involves Chemical Vapor Exposure, gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption. Mechanical filters cannot capture gas-phase contaminants.To finalize the configuration, I need to know the housing length. Which housing length do you need?The selected module (8000 m³/h capacity) is significantly oversized for the requested 800 m³/h (10% utilization). This can lead to uneven air distribution and reduced efficiency. A more appropriate option would be a 300x600 mm module (1000 m³/h capacity).",
