Both stages will use the 900x600mm duct dimensions and 2400 m³/h airflow you specified.To finalize the configuration, I need two details: Which housing length do you need for the GDC carbon filter, and which ATEX zone classification applies (Zone 0/1/2 for gas, Zone 20/21/22 for dust)?",

Therefore, a mechanical pre-filter is mandatory.Additionally, in Zone 22 Explosive Atmospheres, all components must be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures.
