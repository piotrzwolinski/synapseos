The GDMI family, with its bolted construction, does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Additionally, the system has detected several environmental stressors at your location: Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray. Salt spray accelerates corrosion, high humidity reduces service life, and outdoor installation can cause condensation. The housing corrosion class is C4.To proceed with a suitable recommendation, we require additional information to address the risk of outdoor condensation. Please provide the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.",
