      "content": "For the offshore platform project, I see you've selected a GDB-600x600 housing with FZ (C3) material. Unfortunately, this configuration is blocked due to the marine environment.The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and is not rated for marine environments. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel, leading to premature failure. Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation, as the housing is not insulated. High humidity will further accelerate corrosion.The product uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To proceed, you would need a solution rated for ENV_MARINE installation, which typically requires acid-proof stainless steel (C5.1) and a double-wall insulated housing. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a multi-stage assembly, I need the airflow for both stages. Also, what is the filter depth for the GDB stage?",
