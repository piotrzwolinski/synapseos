The bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Salt spray from the marine environment will accelerate corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ) housing. Outdoor condensation and high humidity will further contribute to corrosion.Additionally, the presence of an Explosive Atmosphere requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A suitable solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation and use a construction method that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a preliminary configuration, I need two details:",
