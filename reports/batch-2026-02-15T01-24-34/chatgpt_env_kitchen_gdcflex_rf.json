However, in kitchen environments, grease and oil present in the exhaust stream will irreversibly coat the activated carbon, deactivating it. To prevent this, a mechanical pre-filter is mandatory.The system will consist of two stages:Additionally, the requested 2500 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required.
