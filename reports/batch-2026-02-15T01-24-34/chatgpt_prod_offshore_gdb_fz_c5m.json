However, the GDB housing with C2 corrosion class and FZ (Galvanized) material is not suitable for marine environments due to the presence of Salt Spray, Outdoor Condensation, and High Humidity. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of galvanized steel, outdoor condensation causes surface condensation, and high humidity further accelerates zinc corrosion.The GDB housing is BLOCKED for ENV_MARINE installation because its BOLTED construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously.A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation with a construction type that meets the required leakage class and hygiene standards. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.Here is the multi-stage assembly:",
