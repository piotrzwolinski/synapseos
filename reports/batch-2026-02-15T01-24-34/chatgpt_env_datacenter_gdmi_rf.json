Please select an available material to proceed.This GDMI filter housing configuration is for an outdoor data center intake. Unfortunately, the GDMI filter housing with bolted construction is not rated for outdoor installation due to leakage and hygiene requirements. This configuration is therefore blocked.Additionally, outdoor environments expose the system to high humidity and condensation. High humidity can accelerate zinc corrosion, potentially reducing the service life of the housing. Condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces can also be a significant issue. To mitigate this, a double-wall insulated housing is required to keep the surface above the dew point.I also need two more details to finalize the configuration:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
