      "summary": "The Knowledge Graph demonstrates a high degree of fidelity to the PDF catalog. All 12 product families from the table of contents are present in the graph. The dimensional data across all product families (GDP: 35 sizes, GDB: 27 sizes, GDMI: 35 sizes, GDC: 12 sizes, GDC FLEX: 6 sizes, GDMI FLEX: 8 sizes, BFF: 5 sizes, PFF: 25 sizes, PT: 5 sizes, TT: 35 sizes, EXL: 8 sizes, Filter Profil: 36 variants) has been verified row-by-row against the PDF tables, and all numeric values (airflows, weights, dimensions, cartridge counts, module counts) match exactly with only one known discrepancy (GDB 1800x900 weight, which is flagged as a suspected PDF error).\n\nThe graph handles several PDF inconsistencies appropriately by documenting them as SOURCE_CONFLICT notes: the GDMI length discrepancy between text (550/600, 800/850) and table (600/650, 850/900), and the GDMI default material conflict between text (ZM) and example code (AZ). Material availability per product family is correctly modeled, with GDMI correctly limited to AZ/ZM and GDMI FLEX to FZ/AZ/ZM as shown by the PDF material icons.\n\nThe primary areas for improvement are: (1) adding metadata to distinguish between airflow values calculated at 1.5 m/s (GDP, PFF) versus recommended flows (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX), (2) clarifying the GDMI FLEX long variant description which incorrectly states '600mm cartridge or 450mm+polisfilter' when the PDF says '600 mm cylinder + polisfilter', and (3) verifying the PT material availability regarding the greyed-out RF icon. Overall, the graph scores well at approximately 72/100, with deductions primarily for missing metadata annotations rather than incorrect data."

Several items are correctly flagged as likely PDF-source errors (e.g., GDB 1800x900 weight; GDMI FLEX weight header duplication) and should be carried as provenance notes. One of my own prior findings about GDMI stainless availability was incorrect after checking the GDMI page icons/text (AZ+ZM only; 'Ej i rostfritt'), so I retract it.

    "summary": "The knowledge graph demonstrates strong overall fidelity to the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC Filterskåp PDF catalog (Version 01-09-2025). All 12 product families identified in the table of contents are present and correctly modeled. Dimensional data across all families — including 35 GDP sizes, 27 GDB sizes, 35 GDMI sizes, 12 GDC sizes, 6 GDC FLEX sizes, 8 GDMI FLEX sizes, 5 BFF sizes, 25 PFF sizes, 5 PT sizes, 35 TT sizes, 8 EXL sizes, and 36 Filter Profil variants — has been verified row-by-row with all numeric values (weights, airflows, dimensions, cartridge counts, module counts) matching the PDF exactly, with only one known weight discrepancy (GDB 1800x900) that is correctly flagged as a suspected PDF error.\n\nThe most significant issues requiring correction are: (1) the GDMI FLEX long variant description incorrectly states '600mm cartridge or 450mm+polisfilter' when the PDF clearly specifies '600mm cylinder + polisfilter' for the 1100/1150mm length; (2) a systematic semantic mislabeling where 'max filter depth' is used instead of 'max cartridge/cylinder length' for carbon filter cabinets, which could cause compatibility logic errors; and (3) the GDP default frame depth is set to 25mm while the PDF's example configuration table and code both use 50mm as the standard. The graph appropriately handles several PDF-internal conflicts (GDMI lengths, GDMI default material, GDMI FLEX weight header duplication) by prioritizing tabular data and documenting source conflicts.\n\nSeveral evaluator findings were determined to be false positives during cross-review: the alleged missing 'PTT' product family (PTT on the contents page is simply the abbreviation for PT Plan Övergång, not a separate product), the EXL and Filter Profil code format spacing issues (the PDF examples use spaces matching the graph, not hyphens as claimed), and the GDMI stainless steel availability question (the PDF explicitly states 'Ej i Rostfritt' with only AZ and ZM icons shown). After resolving the confirmed findings — particularly the cartridge length semantics and GDMI FLEX description — the graph would achieve excellent production readiness."
