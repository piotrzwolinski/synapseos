This has resulted in CRITICAL discrepancies where airflow ratings are overstated by nearly double for cartridge and panel filter products, and weights are significantly incorrect.\n\nFurthermore, the graph is missing entire product families listed in the catalog (BFF, Accessories) and lacks the full size range for the GDMI family (missing sizes above 1800x1800). Cartridge counts are also largely missing for the GDC range. Immediate remediation is required to overwrite the incorrect table data with the specific values found in the PDF tables for pages 6, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 21."

Construction/service-access metadata for FLEX families and the 'Outdoor safe' flag for GDMI appear to contradict the PDF’s 'indoor use' positioning. Overall, the graph needs a re-ingestion of every PDF table row per family with strict separation of (a) product-execution corrosion class vs (b) material corrosion class, and family-specific airflow semantics (GDP/PFF vs modular cabinets vs carbon/patron recommended flows)."

      "summary": "The Knowledge Graph has severe systemic data quality issues that would make it unreliable for product recommendations. The most critical problem is that dimension/weight/airflow data appears to have been bulk-copied from the GDB family to nearly all other families (GDP, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, GDMI FLEX, and PFF). This means every single airflow value, weight value, and reference length for these families is wrong. For example, GDP should have airflows based on 1.5 m/s velocity (e.g., 600x600=2000 m³/h) but instead shows GDB values (3400 m³/h). GDP weights should be 4-42 kg range but show 14-92 kg. GDP lengths should be 250mm but show 550mm. The same pattern repeats across all non-GDB families.\n\nBeyond the data copying issue, the graph is missing significant portions of the catalog. GDP is missing 21 of 35 sizes. GDMI is missing 11 sizes (all 2100x and 2400x variants). GDC is missing 2 sizes. Four complete product families (BFF, PT, TT, EXL) and one accessory (Filter Profil) are entirely absent from the graph. The PFF family exists but has completely wrong data - it should be a flat filter frame with 25 sizes and depth options (25/50/100mm), not a housing with GDB-style dimensions.\n\nAdditionally, there are material availability issues (GDMI FLEX default material ambiguity), construction type misclassifications (GDC FLEX and GDMI FLEX labeled as RAIL_MOUNTED), a contradictory outdoor-safe flag on GDMI (which is explicitly indoor-only per PDF), and missing filter module breakdown data for GDB and GDMI. The overall score of 18/100 reflects that while the graph structure and material definitions are reasonable, the actual product data is fundamentally unreliable and would lead to incorrect product selections in nearly every case."

The PDF clearly provides authoritative per-family tables (GDP page with MÅTT table and airflow @1.5 m/s; GDMI/GDB/GDC/GDC FLEX/GDMI FLEX tables; PFF table). One evaluator mis-cited a GDP airflow row (confusing 200x200 with 300x300), and another overstated BFF multi-material availability (BFF page states standard FZ and does not list other material options). Overall, the graph accuracy should be considered low until the missing families are added and each product family’s dimensions/weights/airflows (and for GDC, cartridge counts) are re-ingested from the correct PDF tables, with correct modeling of length ranges (e.g., 550/600, 750/800) and option-driven attributes (ramdjup, connection type, door hinge)."

      "final_assessment": "All three evaluators converge on the same fundamental diagnosis: the graph suffers from a systemic data ingestion error where GDB (Kanalfilterskåp) data was incorrectly propagated to nearly all other product families. This manifests in three critical ways: (1) GDP airflow values are overstated by 70-100% because GDB's 3400 m³/h per module calculation was used instead of GDP's 1.5 m/s velocity-based values from page 6; (2) GDP weights are approximately double what they should be, matching GDB weights instead of GDP's lighter single-wall construction; (3) GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX, and PFF all have incorrect airflow values copied from GDB rather than their product-specific tables. Beyond the data accuracy issues, the graph is missing 5 complete product families (BFF, PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil), 21 GDP sizes, 2 GDC sizes, and 16 GDMI sizes (the 2100 and 2400 series). GDP's reference length is incorrectly set to 550mm instead of 250mm. The gemini_pro evaluator's specific cited values for GDP 300x300 (222 m³/h airflow, 4 kg weight) were incorrect - the actual PDF values are 500 m³/h and 7 kg respectively (those cited values belong to the 200x200 size). The openai evaluator raised valid concerns about length variant modeling (PG vs fläns giving different total lengths like 550/600 and 750/800) that should be addressed. Overall, the graph requires comprehensive remediation of dimensional data across all product families, addition of missing products and sizes, and correction of the GDP length from 550mm to 250mm. The consensus score of 18/100 reflects that while the graph's structural framework is reasonable, the pervasive data accuracy issues render it unreliable for any engineering or commercial purpose."

Each family has its own unique table that must NOT be copied from GDB. This single action addresses ~20 CRITICAL findings.",
      "PRIORITY 2 - ADD MISSING PRODUCT FAMILIES: Create nodes for BFF (page 20), PT (page 22), TT (page 22), EXL (page 23), and Filter Profil (page 23) with all sizes, attributes, and code formats from their respective PDF sections.",
      "PRIORITY 3 - ADD MISSING SIZES: Add 21 missing GDP sizes (page 6), 11 missing GDMI sizes including all 2100x and 2400x variants (page 12), and 2 missing GDC sizes (page 14).",
      "PRIORITY 4 - COMPLETE CARTRIDGE COUNTS: Add CapacityRule nodes for all GDC sizes (10 missing), all GDC FLEX sizes (4 missing), and all GDMI FLEX sizes (6 missing) from their respective PDF tables.",
      "PRIORITY 5 - FIX REFERENCE LENGTHS: Correct GDP from 550→250mm, GDC from 550→750/800mm, GDC FLEX from 550→750/800mm, GDMI from 550→600/650mm, GDMI FLEX from 550→850/900mm, PFF from 550→25/50/100mm (depth, not length).",
      "PRIORITY 6 - ADD DUAL WEIGHT COLUMNS: Store both short and long length-variant weights for GDB (550/600 vs 750/800), GDC (750/800 vs 900/950), GDC FLEX (750/800 vs 900/950), GDMI (600/650 vs 850/900), and GDMI FLEX (850/900 vs 1100/1150).",

      "PRIORITY 9 - COMPLETE OPTIONS: Add missing Fläns ohålad (F) option to GDC, GDMI. Add polisfilter options to GDC FLEX and GDMI FLEX. Add frame depth options (25/50/100) to GDP.",

    "summary": "The knowledge graph suffers from a catastrophic systemic data ingestion error: the GDB (Kanalfilterskåp / Duct Filter Cabinet) dimension table was incorrectly propagated to nearly all other product families — GDP, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, GDMI FLEX, and PFF. This means every airflow value, weight value, and reference length for these six families is wrong. GDP airflows are overstated by 40-70% (e.g., 600x600 shows 3400 m³/h instead of the correct 2000 m³/h). GDP weights are approximately double what they should be (e.g., 600x600 shows 27 kg instead of 12 kg). GDP's reference length is 550mm instead of the correct 250mm. Carbon/cartridge families (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) show modular-cabinet airflows instead of their recommended flows, which are roughly half the displayed values. PFF, which is a flat filter frame with depth options of 25/50/100mm, is incorrectly modeled as a housing with GDB-style dimensions.\n\nBeyond the data accuracy crisis, the graph is missing five complete product families that are defined in the catalog: BFF (Påsfilterram), PT (Plan Övergång), TT (Konisk Övergång), EXL (Excenterlåsning), and Filter Profil. The graph is also missing 21 of 35 GDP sizes, 11 of 39 GDMI sizes (the entire 2100x and 2400x series), and 2 of 12 GDC sizes. Cartridge counts are missing for the majority of GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX sizes. Construction type metadata for FLEX families is incorrect (labeled RAIL_MOUNTED without PDF support), and GDMI is contradictorily marked as both indoor-only and outdoor-safe.\n\nAll three independent evaluators converged on the same fundamental diagnosis with high confidence. The consensus score of 18/100 reflects that while the graph's structural framework and GDB-specific data are largely correct, the pervasive cross-family data contamination and missing products render the graph unreliable for engineering specifications, product selection, or commercial use. Immediate remediation requires re-ingesting each family's specific PDF table and adding all missing product families and sizes."
