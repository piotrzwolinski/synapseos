Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for your marine chemical plant application is currently blocked. The GDMI family housings, while having a C4 corrosion class, use a bolted construction that does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Additionally, the selected GDMI housing is unsuitable for marine environments due to the presence of salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. The persistent high humidity will also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing the service life of the housing. Finally, outdoor installation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.To proceed, a solution would need to meet C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance standards and have a construction suitable for marine environments. Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all these requirements simultaneously.
