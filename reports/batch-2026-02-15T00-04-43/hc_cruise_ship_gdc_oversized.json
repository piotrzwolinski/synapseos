Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on the housing's surface. The bolted construction of this product does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation and handle the specified airflow. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.The requested 2600 m³/h airflow also exceeds the maximum capacity of 2000 m³/h for a single 600x600 GDC module. To proceed with the GDC stage, I need the filter depth for the GDC carbon filter.To finalize the configuration:High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
