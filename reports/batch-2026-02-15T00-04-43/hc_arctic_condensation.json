Outdoor installations expose the system to Outdoor Condensation and High Humidity. The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. To prevent condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces, a double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation (ENV_OUTDOOR) and have a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene requirements. I recommend contacting the manufacturer's Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.I am pivoting to the GDMI FLEX series, which is better suited for your application. To finalize the configuration, I need to know the filter dimensions and the airflow for your application.",
