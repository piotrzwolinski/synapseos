While the reasoning regarding filtration types is slightly muddled (implying mechanical filters aren't for particulates), the safety logic regarding the explosive atmosphere is sound and decisive.",

            "correctness": "The system correctly states that GDB is not designed for ATEX Zone 21, as the PDF (p.8) lists it only for standard indoor use (C2) with no mention of Ex-ratings.",

            "safety": "The system demonstrates excellent risk awareness by blocking a standard steel housing in a Zone 21 explosive dust environment.",
            "tone": "Professional and authoritative regarding safety constraints.",
            "reasoning_quality": "The ATEX reasoning is perfect; however, the claim that GDB is unsuitable for 'Particulate Exposure' is technically phrasing error (GDB is for particulates), but the conclusion is correct.",
