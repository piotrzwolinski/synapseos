The presence of Chemical Vapor Exposure and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion from the wastewater treatment process creates a corrosive environment. Hydrogen sulfide aggressively attacks zinc coatings. The housing corrosion class is C2.GDB housings use bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. The specified FZ (C3 galvanized) material is also unsuitable, as it corrodes rapidly in H2S environments. Minimum C5 material is required.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation and use a welded construction to meet leakage and hygiene requirements. It would also need to be made of a material with a corrosion class of C5 or higher to withstand the H2S. I recommend contacting the manufacturer's Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
