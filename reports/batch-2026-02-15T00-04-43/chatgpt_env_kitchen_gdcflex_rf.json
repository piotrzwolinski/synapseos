Even trace amounts of Grease/Oil Exposure will irreversibly block the carbon pores, rendering the filter ineffective. To prevent this, a mechanical pre-filter is required upstream.The system will consist of:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP PlanfilterskåpStage 2 (TARGET): GDC_FLEX familyBoth stages will use 1200x600mm housings made of RF (Stainless Steel) for corrosion resistance in the kitchen environment. The housings have a C2 corrosion class.To finalize the configuration, I need one detail:Which housing length is required?Additionally, the requested 2500 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required.
