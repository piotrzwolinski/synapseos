      "content": "For the hospital rooftop kitchen exhaust application, we need to address several environmental factors and installation constraints. The selected GDC_FLEX unit is blocked due to these issues.The GDC_FLEX is not suitable for marine environments due to its rail-mounted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Additionally, the unit's housing has a C2 corrosion class, which is insufficient for the detected Salt Spray. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of C3-rated materials, leading to premature failure. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.Furthermore, the GDC_FLEX is not insulated, making it susceptible to Outdoor Condensation. Condensation forms on non-insulated metal surfaces in outdoor installations. Double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.The system will also be exposed to High Humidity, which reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. It is also exposed to Chemical Vapor Exposure, requiring activated carbon adsorption. Finally, the kitchen environment introduces Grease/Oil Exposure, which will irreversibly deactivate the carbon filter. Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. A pre-filter stage is mandatory.The requested 3000 m³/h airflow also exceeds the maximum capacity of 1750 m³/h for a single 600x600 module. Two modules are needed.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements: marine-grade construction, double-wall insulation, grease pre-filtration, and higher airflow capacity.",
