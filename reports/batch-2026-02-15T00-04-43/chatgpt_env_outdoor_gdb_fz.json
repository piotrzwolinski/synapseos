GDB housings use bolted construction and are not rated for outdoor environments due to leakage and hygiene concerns. Outdoor installation also exposes the system to high humidity and condensation.Condensation can form on non-insulated metal surfaces, while high humidity reduces the carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerates corrosion. The housing corrosion class is C2.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation (ENV_OUTDOOR) and use a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene requirements. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a suitable configuration, I recommend the GDMI FLEX series. To finalize the configuration:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
