Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for your coastal industrial facility is currently blocked. The GDMI filter housing is not rated for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the required leakage class and hygiene standards for such settings. Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, and C3-rated materials like galvanized steel will fail prematurely in these conditions. Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.To proceed, we need to address these environmental factors. The system has detected stressors including Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray. To recommend a suitable solution, I need two more details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",

Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces."
