For medical/cleanroom applications, VDI 6022 recommends C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) for hygienic surfaces.Also, the system will be installed in an explosive atmosphere (ATEX Zone 22). Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. Therefore, all metallic housing components must be grounded/earthed to prevent static discharge. Anti-static filter media with conductive fibers or grounding strips is also required, as standard filter media is NOT suitable for ATEX zones. Equipotential bonding between all housing sections is necessary, along with compliance with EN 60079-0 and EN 60079-31. Equipment must meet minimum Category 3D protection level.What is the required airflow (m³/h)?",
