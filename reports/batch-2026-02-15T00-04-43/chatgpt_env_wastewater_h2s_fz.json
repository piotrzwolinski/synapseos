It is only approved for indoor (ENV_INDOOR) and ATEX (ENV_ATEX) environments.Additionally, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) aggressively attacks zinc coatings like the FZ (C3 galvanized) material specified, leading to rapid corrosion. A minimum C5 material (RF or SF) is required for H2S environments.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To proceed, you would need a solution rated for ENV_WASTEWATER that uses a welded construction to ensure proper sealing and hygiene, and is made from stainless steel (RF) or acid-proof stainless steel (SF) to resist H2S corrosion.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
