The system is exposed to high humidity and outdoor condensation.However, this configuration is blocked. The GDMI filter housing with bolted construction is not rated for outdoor installation, as it does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments.To proceed, you would need a housing specifically designed and rated for outdoor use, featuring a welded construction to ensure proper sealing and prevent moisture ingress. Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies these requirements. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?",

However, the block reasoning is overly conservative — GDMI is an insulated, double-walled housing rated C4 (ZM), which is actually better suited for condensation-prone environments than most alternatives. The catalog says 'för inomhusbruk' (indoor use), which supports the concern, but the system's specific claims about 'leakage class and hygiene requirements' and 'welded construction' requirements are not well-substantiated from the catalog or standard HVAC practice for rooftop installations.",
