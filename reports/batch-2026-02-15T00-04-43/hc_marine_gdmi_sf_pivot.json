Marine environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.Additionally, the GDMI family uses bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously.
