These housings use activated carbon adsorption to remove gas-phase contaminants, which is necessary for odor control.However, the GDC-1200x1200 module has a capacity of 8000 m³/h, while your application requires only 800 m³/h. This extreme oversizing can lead to low face velocity and uneven air distribution, reducing the filter's efficiency. I recommend a smaller module that is better matched to your airflow requirements.Consider either the GDC-300x600 or GDC-600x300 module, both of which have a reference airflow of 1000 m³/h. The housings have a C2 corrosion class and are suitable for indoor use.The selected module (8000 m³/h capacity) is significantly oversized for the requested 800 m³/h (10% utilization). This can lead to uneven air distribution and reduced efficiency. A more appropriate option would be a 300x600 mm module (1000 m³/h capacity).",
