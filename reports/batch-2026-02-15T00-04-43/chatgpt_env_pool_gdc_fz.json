The GDC housing with C2 corrosion class and FZ (C3) material is not suitable for environments with Chlorine Exposure because the zinc coating (C3) dissolves in chlorinated environments within months. Additionally, the product is not rated for ENV_POOL installation. It uses a bolted construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.The system is also exposed to High Humidity, which reduces carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerates zinc corrosion.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be constructed from stainless steel (C5) or better to withstand the chlorine, and it would need to be rated for pool environments with a welded construction to ensure proper hygiene and leakage control. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
