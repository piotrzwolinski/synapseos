Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the galvanized (FZ) material. Outdoor installation causes condensation on the housing. High humidity will further accelerate corrosion.The GDB family is therefore blocked for this project. The bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation, which typically requires welded construction to ensure proper sealing and hygiene.
