      "content": "**Important:** RF (stainless steel) is **not available** for GDMI. Available material options: Aluzink, Zinkmagnesium. Please select an available material to proceed.This GDMI configuration for your offshore project is currently blocked due to environmental factors.The selected GDMI filter housing is not suitable for marine environments because its bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for ENV_MARINE installations. Specifically, the GDMI housing is rated C4 for corrosion resistance, but marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance due to the presence of Salt Spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. Additionally, High Humidity can accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing the service life of the housing. Finally, Outdoor Condensation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To address these issues, a solution would need to have C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a construction type suitable for marine environments. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
