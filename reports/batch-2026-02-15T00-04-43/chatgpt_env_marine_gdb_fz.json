Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ), while outdoor condensation can cause moisture to accumulate on the housing. For marine/coastal environments, C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance is required.Additionally, the GDB housing's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to have C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a construction type that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with specifying the assembly, I need two details:",
