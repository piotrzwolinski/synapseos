      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation requiring 1750 m³/h airflow, the GDC_FLEX filter housing in stainless steel (RF) is unfortunately not suitable. The GDC_FLEX's rail-mounted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for pharmaceutical environments. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.Additionally, the GDC_FLEX is unsuitable for your application due to the presence of particulate and chemical vapor exposure, as well as outdoor condensation. Particulate exposure requires mechanical filtration, while the GDC_FLEX uses carbon adsorption, which is ineffective against solid particulates. Chemical vapor exposure requires activated carbon adsorption. Finally, outdoor installation can cause condensation on the non-insulated metal surfaces of the GDC_FLEX. The housing has a corrosion class of C2.To address these issues, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical filtration to capture particulate matter, protecting the downstream carbon filters.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDMI Modulfilterskåp provides activated carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors. Note that for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, the requested stainless steel (RF) material is unavailable. However, Aluzink (AZ) and ZinkMagnesium (ZM) are available.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:For the GDMI Modulfilterskåp (Stage 2), what filter depth do you require?",

Particulate exposure requires mechanical filtration, while the GDC_FLEX uses carbon adsorption, which is ineffective against solid particulates. Chemical vapor exposure requires activated carbon adsorption. Finally, outdoor installation can cause condensation on the non-insulated metal surfaces of the GDC_FLEX. The housing has a corrosion class of C2."
