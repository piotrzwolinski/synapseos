      "summary": "Dimension/airflow/weight tables for GDP, GDB, GDMI, GDC, and GDMI FLEX largely match the PDF numerically row-for-row based on the provided graph tables; the biggest concrete data integrity fault found is the GDC FLEX WxH inversion for the first size (PDF Bredd=300, Höjd=600 vs graph key 600x300), which is CRITICAL because it breaks sizing and cartridge selection. A second high-impact class of issues is SKU/code-format fidelity: the graph invents option code tokens (PF) not defined by the PDF and encodes depth into Filter Profil codes even though the PDF example code does not include it. These can cause incorrect code generation and ordering errors.\n\nMaterial availability is mostly aligned when using the PDF icon rows, but there is at least one direct mismatch: TT should not include RF based on the icons. Several other items are not strict mismatches but source-of-truth governance issues (chlorine ppm limits not in PDF, and 'suspected PDF error' annotations that risk overriding catalog values). Overall, the graph is close on the numeric tables, but needs tightening on canonical WxH conventions, strict adherence to PDF-defined order code tokens, and clearer separation between PDF-verified facts vs external engineering enrichments."

      "summary": "The Knowledge Graph demonstrates a high level of fidelity to the PDF catalog. All 12 product families from the table of contents are present, and the dimensional data (sizes, weights, airflow ratings, cartridge counts) has been accurately transcribed across all product families. The graph correctly captures 35 GDP sizes, 27 GDB sizes, 35 GDMI sizes (including the larger 2100-2400 range), 12 GDC sizes, 6 GDC FLEX sizes, 8 GDMI FLEX sizes, 5 BFF sizes, 25 PFF sizes, 5 PT sizes, 35 TT sizes, 8 EXL sizes, and 36 Filter Profil combinations. Material availability per family is correctly modeled, including the restriction of GDMI and GDMI FLEX to non-stainless materials.\n\nThe graph demonstrates good engineering judgment in handling PDF inconsistencies. Three notable conflicts are properly documented: (1) the GDMI text vs. table length discrepancy (550/600 vs 600/650), (2) the GDMI default material conflict (text says ZM, example code uses AZ), and (3) the GDMI FLEX weight column header duplication. The GDB 1800x900 weight anomaly (36 kg) is correctly flagged as a suspected PDF error. The GDC FLEX width/height label inconsistency is also properly noted.\n\nAreas for improvement are relatively minor: adding max filter class ratings (F9) to GDP, GDB, and GDMI; adding structured compatible filter type data to GDC/GDC FLEX/GDMI FLEX; capturing the aluminum profile framework detail for GDMI/GDMI FLEX construction; and making code format templates dynamic to handle option variants (left-hinge, flange). The chlorine PPM values on materials appear to be from external engineering references rather than the PDF catalog, which is appropriately noted. Overall, this is a well-constructed knowledge graph with thorough source conflict documentation."

      "MAJOR: Fix Filter Profil code format to 'Filter profil-{width} {material}' (remove depth token) to match PDF example.",

      "MINOR: Add velocity_basis/flow_type metadata to all flow rate data to prevent incorrect cross-family comparisons.",
      "MINOR: Make code format templates dynamic for connection type (PG vs F/F40/FC40) and hinge direction (R vs L).",

    "summary": "The knowledge graph demonstrates strong structural coverage of the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC filter cabinet catalog, with all 12 product families correctly represented and dimensional data (sizes, weights, airflow ratings, cartridge counts) accurately transcribed for the vast majority of entries across 35 GDP sizes, 27 GDB sizes, 35 GDMI sizes, 12 GDC sizes, 6 GDC FLEX sizes, 8 GDMI FLEX sizes, 5 BFF sizes, 25 PFF sizes, 5 PT sizes, 35 TT sizes, 8 EXL sizes, and 36 Filter Profil combinations. Material availability per family is correctly modeled in most cases, including the restriction of GDMI to AZ/ZM only. The graph also demonstrates good engineering judgment in handling three confirmed PDF source errors: the GDMI text vs. table length discrepancy, the GDMI FLEX duplicate weight column header, and the GDB 1800x900 anomalous weight value.\n\nThe most significant data integrity issue is the GDC FLEX size key inversion for the first row ('600x300' should be '300x600' per the table's Bredd/Höjd columns), which is a concrete mismatch that would break sizing and selection. The second class of high-impact issues involves ordering code fidelity: the graph invents option code tokens ('PF') not defined in the PDF, includes depth in the Filter Profil code contrary to the PDF example, and may not preserve the exact hyphenated FLEX prefixes used in catalog ordering examples. Additionally, external engineering enrichments (chlorine PPM limits) are not clearly separated from catalog-verified data, creating a provenance risk.\n\nOverall, the graph achieves approximately 82% accuracy against the catalog source of truth. The numeric/dimensional data is highly reliable, but code format governance, metadata completeness (certifications, filter class limits, flow velocity basis), and strict source-of-truth separation need tightening before production deployment. The recommended fixes are well-defined and prioritized, with the critical GDC FLEX size correction and external data separation being the highest-priority items."
