This pre-filtration is critical because activated carbon's adsorption capability is rendered useless once the pores are blocked.The second stage is the GDC filter itself. However, due to the GDC requiring a minimum housing length of 750mm for the carbon cylinders, the housing length has been auto-corrected from 250mm to 750mm.To finalize the configuration, I need to know the required airflow (m³/h) for both stages.",

      "content": "For the cement project in the flour mill, we recommend a two-stage filtration system to address both Particulate Exposure and the Explosive Atmosphere. The housing corrosion class is C2.The flour mill environment exposes the system to Particulate Exposure, which can block the activated carbon pores in the GDC filter, reducing its effectiveness. To prevent this, the GDP pre-filter is essential for removing particulates before they reach the GDC filter.Given the presence of an Explosive Atmosphere (ATEX Zone 22), all components must be grounded to prevent static discharge, which could be an ignition source. This requires grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components, anti-static filter media, and equipotential bonding between all housing sections, in compliance with EN 60079-0 and EN 60079-31.**Note**: Particle capture requires mechanical filtration (bag or panel filters). Carbon adsorption is ineffective against solid particulates. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Explosive atmosphere (ATEX zone) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: (1) Grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components to prevent static discharge; (2) Anti-static filter media with conductive fibers or grounding strips — standard filter media is NOT suitable for ATEX zones; (3) Equipotential bonding between all housing sections; (4) Compliance with EN 60079-0 (general requirements) and EN 60079-31 (dust ignition protection). For Zone 22 (combustible dust): equipment must meet minimum Category 3D protection level. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
