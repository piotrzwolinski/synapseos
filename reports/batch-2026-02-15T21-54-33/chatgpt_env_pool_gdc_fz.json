      "content": "This configuration for air recirculation in a swimming pool environment is currently blocked. The GDC filter housing with a C2 corrosion class and FZ (galvanized steel) construction is not suitable for environments with chlorine exposure and high humidity.The zinc coating (C3) of the FZ material rapidly corrodes in the presence of chlorine, leading to premature failure. High humidity will accelerate this corrosion process. For chlorine environments, a minimum of C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) is required.Additionally, the GDC housing is not rated for swimming pool environments due to leakage and hygiene requirements. No standard catalog product currently satisfies both the material and environmental requirements for this application.To address these issues, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system. The first stage, a GDP Planfilterskåp, will act as a PROTECTOR to remove particulate matter. The second stage, a GDC filter, will provide carbon/chemical filtration. Both stages will use 600x600mm housings.To proceed with the configuration, I need two details:What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?",
