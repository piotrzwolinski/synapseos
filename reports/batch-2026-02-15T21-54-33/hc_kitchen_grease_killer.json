Grease/Oil Exposure is particularly critical because lipids can irreversibly contaminate the activated carbon in the GDC_FLEX, reducing its effectiveness. To address this, a two-stage filtration system is required.The system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp pre-filter to remove grease and particulate, followed by the GDC_FLEX for odor and gas removal. Both stages will use the 600x600mm duct dimensions.**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Kitchen/grease environments need mechanical pre-filtration before any carbon stage to protect carbon from lipid contamination. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Even trace grease permanently deactivates carbon.
