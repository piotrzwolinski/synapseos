Please select an available material to proceed.For your marine chemical plant application, I understand you need a filter housing with corrosion resistance. The GDMI family, while offering a C3 corrosion class, is not suitable for marine environments due to the presence of salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.To provide a complete solution, we'll use a two-stage filtration system. The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp to pre-filter the air and protect the second-stage GDMI filter from salt spray. This ensures the GDMI's C3 rating is sufficient for your needs.I also need to gather some additional data to finalize the configuration. First, SF (Syrafast Stainless Steel) is unavailable for the GDMI product family. Would you prefer Aluzink or Zinkmagnesium ZM310?Second, to address the risk of outdoor condensation, I need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.Which housing length do you need for both stages?High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
