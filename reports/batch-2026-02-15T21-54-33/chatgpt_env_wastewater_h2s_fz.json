The housing has a corrosion class of C2. H2S aggressively attacks zinc coatings, and FZ (C3 galvanized) corrodes rapidly in such environments. The SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.This configuration is therefore BLOCKED. No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously.A suitable solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation and constructed with materials that can withstand H2S corrosion.
