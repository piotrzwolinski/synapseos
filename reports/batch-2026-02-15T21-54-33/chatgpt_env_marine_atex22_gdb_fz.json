      "content": "The GDB filter housing is not suitable for the offshore environment due to the risk of outdoor condensation and salt spray. Outdoor installation causes condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces, and the C2-rated housing with FZ (C3) material will corrode prematurely in the presence of salt spray.To provide a suitable solution for your offshore application in an ATEX Zone 22, I recommend a two-stage filtration system. This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target stage. The GDMI is approved for marine environments.The explosive atmosphere in ATEX Zone 22 requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. This system will require grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components, anti-static filter media, and equipotential bonding between all housing sections.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the required airflow for the 600x600mm system?What is the filter depth required for the GDMI Modulfilterskåp?High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Keep relative humidity below 70% for optimal performance.",
