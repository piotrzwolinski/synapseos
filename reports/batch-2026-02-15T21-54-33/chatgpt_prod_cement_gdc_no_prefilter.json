Particulate Exposure can block the activated carbon pores, reducing its effectiveness. The Explosive Atmosphere requires special grounding considerations to prevent static discharge.The system consists of a GDP Planfilterskåp pre-filter to remove particulates, followed by a GDC family filter for gas adsorption. The GDP pre-filter is essential to protect the GDC filter from particulate fouling.Both stages will use the specified duct dimensions of 900x600mm.The housing corrosion class is C2.**Note**: Particle capture requires mechanical filtration (bag or panel filters). Carbon adsorption is ineffective against solid particulates. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Explosive atmosphere (ATEX zone) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: (1) Grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components to prevent static discharge; (2) Anti-static filter media with conductive fibers or grounding strips — standard filter media is NOT suitable for ATEX zones; (3) Equipotential bonding between all housing sections; (4) Compliance with EN 60079-0 (general requirements) and EN 60079-31 (dust ignition protection). For Zone 22 (combustible dust): equipment must meet minimum Category 3D protection level. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
