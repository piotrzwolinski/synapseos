Also, given the presence of an Explosive Atmosphere (ATEX Zone 22), all components must be grounded to prevent ignition sources from static discharge. This requires grounding of all metallic housing components and the use of anti-static filter media.Please ensure that all installation guidelines for ATEX Zone 22 are followed.Note that the module capacity of 850 m³/h is significantly higher than your required airflow of 150 m³/h. This oversizing can lead to low face velocity and uneven air distribution. Consider using a smaller module size such as 300x600 mm or 600x300 mm for better performance.The selected module (850 m³/h capacity) is significantly oversized for the requested 150 m³/h (18% utilization). This can lead to uneven air distribution and reduced efficiency. A more appropriate option would be a 300x600 mm module (1700 m³/h capacity).**Note**: Explosive atmosphere (ATEX zone) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: (1) Grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components to prevent static discharge; (2) Anti-static filter media with conductive fibers or grounding strips — standard filter media is NOT suitable for ATEX zones; (3) Equipotential bonding between all housing sections; (4) Compliance with EN 60079-0 (general requirements) and EN 60079-31 (dust ignition protection). For Zone 22 (combustible dust): equipment must meet minimum Category 3D protection level. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
