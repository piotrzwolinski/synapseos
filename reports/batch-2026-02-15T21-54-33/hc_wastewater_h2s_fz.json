The system detects both Chemical Vapor Exposure and H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion in this environment. The GDB housing with a C2 corrosion class is not suitable for wastewater treatment plants due to the presence of H2S. Hydrogen sulfide aggressively attacks zinc coatings, and FZ (C3 galvanized) corrodes rapidly in such environments. The product is not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation (allowed: ENV_INDOOR, ENV_ATEX). This product uses SINGLE_WALL_UNINSULATED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation and use a material with a corrosion class of C5 or higher to withstand H2S corrosion. Since no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements, I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
