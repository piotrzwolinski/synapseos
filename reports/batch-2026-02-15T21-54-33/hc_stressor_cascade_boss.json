This configuration is therefore BLOCKED. The single-wall construction does not provide adequate insulation against Outdoor Condensation, and the C2 corrosion class is insufficient to withstand Salt Spray. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance, and outdoor installations require double-wall insulated housings to prevent condensation.Additionally, the system will be exposed to High Humidity, Chemical Vapor Exposure, and Grease/Oil Exposure. Grease/Oil Exposure is particularly critical, as lipids will permanently deactivate carbon filters. To address these concerns, a multi-stage filtration system is required:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical pre-filtration to protect the carbon stage from Grease/Oil Exposure.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDMI Modulfilterskåp provides carbon filtration for Chemical Vapor Exposure.The requested airflow of 3000 m³/h exceeds the capacity of a single 600x600 module (1750 m³/h). Therefore, two modules in parallel are required, resulting in effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm. For the GDMI filter, RF material is unavailable. AZ and ZM are available.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:",
