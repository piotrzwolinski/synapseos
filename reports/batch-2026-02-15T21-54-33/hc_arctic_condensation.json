The single-wall uninsulated construction of the GDB housing does not provide sufficient thermal insulation to prevent condensation on the housing's surfaces when exposed to the low outdoor temperatures. This is a critical constraint.Additionally, the location's high humidity can reduce the carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerate zinc corrosion.
