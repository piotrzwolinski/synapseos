The single-wall construction of the GDB housing (corrosion class C2) does not provide sufficient thermal insulation to prevent condensation, which can lead to corrosion and reduced filter performance.Additionally, the rooftop environment exposes the system to high humidity, which can reduce the carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerate corrosion of the housing.I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp or GDMI FLEX, which are designed for outdoor use and provide better protection against these environmental factors. To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
