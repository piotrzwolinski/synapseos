          "explanation": "The consultant correctly asked for missing housing length and the airflow sizing is directionally fine, but it makes critical catalog and engineering mistakes: it labels the selected RF stainless housing as corrosion class C2 and provides an incorrect weight for GDC 600x600/900. It also fails to close the loop on the earlier humidity warning (85% RH) when confirming suitability.",

            "correctness": "PDF shows GDC 600x600 has recommended airflow 2000 m³/h and weight 40 kg at 900/950 length, but the response states ~32 kg and incorrectly claims the housing has corrosion class C2; the humidity/carbon-efficiency warning is generally sound engineering.",
            "completeness": "It does not actually confirm performance suitability at 85% RH (capacity derate, expected breakthrough, or need for dehumidification) and omits any pressure-drop/Δp or media selection discussion.",
            "safety": "It flags high humidity as a performance risk for activated carbon, but then provides a 'suitable' conclusion without reiterating mitigation (RH control, media choice) or adding a warning on the final selection.",
            "tone": "Professional and appropriately technical for a sales-engineering interaction.",
            "reasoning_quality": "The initial logic (humidity reduces adsorption; need carbon for gas-phase) is coherent, but the final conclusion contradicts the earlier risk framing and includes an unsupported corrosion-class statement.",
            "constraint_adherence": "It violates catalog/material logic by asserting C2 for an RF stainless configuration and duplicates the same product card twice, indicating poor adherence to internal output constraints."
