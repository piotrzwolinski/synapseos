      "content": "For the restaurant exhaust application, the GDC_FLEX family is designed for porous adsorption to remove chemical vapors. However, this application also involves Grease/Oil Exposure. Lipids will irreversibly contaminate the activated carbon pores, which reduces the filter's effectiveness. To address this, a two-stage filtration system is required.The system will consist of:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides mechanical pre-filtration to remove grease and oil.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC_FLEX family provides porous adsorption for chemical vapor removal.To finalize the configuration, we need the housing length for both stages.Additionally, the requested 2500 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 2500 m³/h.**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Kitchen/grease environments need mechanical pre-filtration before any carbon stage to protect carbon from lipid contamination. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Even trace grease permanently deactivates carbon. A pre-filter stage is mandatory for any application where grease, oil, or fat is present in the airstream. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
