*The system failed critically on product selection and engineering logic. It recommended a 'GDP' housing with 550mm length (GDP is strictly 250mm per PDF) to accommodate a 150mm filter (GDP max is 100mm). Furthermore, the final product card contains a catastrophic calculation error: it lists the rated airflow as 23,800 m³/h, derived by multiplying the *total* requested airflow (3400) by the number of modules (7), rather than summing the module capacities.*

Strengths: Correctly identified that a single 300x300 module (500 m³/h) is insufficient for 3400 m³/h; Correctly looked up the weight for a 300x300 module (7kg)
Weaknesses: Catastrophic math error in final card (7 x Total Flow instead of 7 x Unit Flow); Hallucinated product dimensions (GDP 550mm length does not exist); Failed to switch to GDB or GDMI family for 150mm filter depth requirement; Incoherent response structure (listing 4 items but specifying 7 modules required)

*The system correctly flags that 3400 m³/h cannot be handled by four 300x300 GDP units, but it then outputs incorrect product configuration data (wrong housing length, wrong airflow math, and ignores the user’s 150 mm depth). It also duplicates identical items and provides a misleading product card capacity statement.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that a single 300x300 GDP module is only suitable for ~500 m³/h and that ~7 parallel units would be needed for 3400 m³/h.; Appropriate clarification question (filter depth) before finalizing a configuration.
Weaknesses: Incorrect product data and math in the final output (GDP length, airflow aggregation statement, and weight handling), plus duplicated/meaningless itemization.; Ignores the user’s 150 mm depth requirement and does not explain that GDP is limited to 25/50/100 mm filter depth and fixed 250 mm housing length.

### chatgpt_env_marine_gdmi_rf — 4.3 FAIL

**Query:** GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 75.5s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDMI 600x600 RF for offshore.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> For the offshore project, I see you've selected a GDMI filter housing with 600x600mm dimensions.
> 
> However, the GDMI family is not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. The housing corrosion class is C4, but marine environments require C5.1.
> 
> Additionally, outdoor installations expose the system to outdoor condensation and high humidity, which can cause further material degradation.
> 
> Unfortunately, RF (Stainless Steel) is not available for the GDMI product family. To proceed, we can offer Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (corrosion class C5) or Aluzink (corrosion class C4).

*The system demonstrates excellent product knowledge by correctly identifying that the GDMI family is not available in Stainless Steel (RF), a specific constraint on PDF page 11 that overrides the general summary. It also applies sound engineering judgment regarding marine corrosion risks. However, the response is critically incomplete; it states "I need two details:" but fails to list the questions, effectively truncating the interaction.*

Strengths: Correctly caught the specific "No RF" (Stainless Steel) constraint for GDMI on PDF page 11; Sound engineering advice regarding corrosion classes (C4 vs C5) in marine environments
Weaknesses: Critical formatting failure: the response ends abruptly without listing the requested clarification details

*The response correctly flags offshore/marine corrosion risk and avoids issuing a product card prematurely, but it contains a critical catalog mismatch: GDMI is shown as available in RF (stainless) in the provided PDF. It also mixes up corrosion-class statements (GDMI described as C4 while RF is C5) and doesn’t ask the two missing details it claims to need.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies offshore/marine corrosion as a key selection driver and raises a risk warning.; Avoids issuing final product cards before collecting missing parameters.
Weaknesses: Critical product-data error: claims GDMI cannot be ordered in RF despite the PDF indicating RF is an option.; Incomplete clarification: states it needs two details but does not specify what they are, and provides no concrete alternative selection (size/length/material code).

*The system demonstrates excellent product knowledge by correctly identifying a specific catalog constraint (GDMI is not available in Stainless Steel) and correctly sizing the unit. However, the response is a technical failure because it cuts off mid-sentence without providing the product code and fails to ask for the required housing length parameter.*

Strengths: Accurate identification of material unavailability for the specific product family (GDMI); Correct sizing based on airflow data
Weaknesses: Response is truncated/malformed and fails to generate the product code; Fails to ask for housing length (required for specification)

*The system correctly flags that GDMI is not offered in syrafast stainless (SF) per the catalog and appropriately steers toward ZM/AZ for corrosion resistance. However, it then asserts a 600x600 size without the user providing dimensions and fails to output any actual product code, making the recommendation incomplete and partially inconsistent with the user request.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies that GDMI is not available in SF/316 and offers catalog-valid alternatives (AZ/ZM).; Recognizes marine/chemical exposure as a corrosion-critical environment and highlights material durability concerns.
Weaknesses: Fails to deliver the requested product code and provides no product card/output despite claiming a 'correct product code would be'.; Assumes 600x600 dimensions from airflow alone instead of requesting W×H, length option, and connection/door details.

### chatgpt_env_pool_gdb_fz — 5.0 PASS

**Query:** GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.
**Category:** environment | **Turns:** 1 | **Product:** no | **Duration:** 48.6s

**USER** (turn 1):
> GDB 600x600 FZ for indoor swimming pool.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> The GDB filter housing with dimensions 600x600mm is intended for an indoor swimming pool application. This environment exposes the system to high humidity and chlorine exposure.
> 
> The current housing material, FZ (C3), is not suitable for environments with chlorine exposure. Chlorine will corrode the zinc coating within months, leading to premature failure. To ensure adequate corrosion resistance, a minimum of C5 is required.
> 
> Suitable alternative materials for the GDB housing include Rostfritt 1.4301/SS2333 (C5), Zinkmagnesium ZM310 (C5), or Syrafast 1.4404/SS2348 (C5.1).
> 
> To proceed with the configuration, I need to know which material you would like to use for the housing and the required airflow.

*The system acted perfectly as a technical consultant. It correctly identified a critical engineering risk (using galvanized steel in a swimming pool environment) and blocked the configuration. It provided sound alternative material recommendations based on the corrosion classes defined in the PDF and standard HVAC best practices.*

Strengths: Critical safety intervention preventing premature product failure; Accurate mapping of corrosion classes (C3 vs C5) to application; Correct workflow (resolving material before sizing)

*The system correctly flags that a swimming pool environment (humid + chlorinated air) is aggressive and that a galvanized (FZ) housing is a poor choice, then asks for missing selection inputs (material and airflow) before issuing product cards. However, it overstates the catalog corrosion class for FZ and implies GDB has stainless/ZM options without verifying that those materials are actually offered for GDB in the provided PDF excerpt.*

Strengths: Correctly identifies swimming pool/chlorine exposure as a high-corrosion environment and blocks FZ accordingly.; Good clarification behavior: asks for airflow and material before issuing a final configuration/product card.
Weaknesses: Misstates/overgeneralizes corrosion class for FZ (calls it C3) versus the GDB product page indicating C2 for the standard execution.; Does not verify from the PDF that GDB can be ordered in RF/ZM/SF; should ask/confirm availability or propose GDMI (ZM) as the catalog-backed corrosion-resistant alternative.

**USER** (turn 1):
> Ship installation. We require insulation and Syrafast stainless (SF). Please provide GDMI-SF.

**SYSTEM** (turn 1):
> The GDMI family is designed for indoor use and is not suitable for marine/offshore environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. The housing has a C4 corrosion class.
> 
> Additionally, outdoor installation exposes the system to outdoor condensation and high humidity, which can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.
> 
> Unfortunately, Syrafast stainless steel (SF) is not available for the GDMI product family. However, we can offer Zinkmagnesium (ZM310), which has a C5 corrosion class suitable for marine environments, or Aluzink, which has a C4 corrosion class.

*The system correctly identifies a critical product constraint: the GDMI family is not available in stainless steel (SF/RF). It also correctly flags the environmental risk of using an indoor-rated housing in a marine application. The response is safe, accurate to the catalog, and asks for the necessary missing parameters (dimensions/airflow) to proceed.*

Strengths: Correctly identified that GDMI is not available in Stainless/Syrafast (Page 11); Appropriately flagged marine environment risks for an indoor-rated product; Did not hallucinate a product code for the requested configuration

*The system correctly flags marine corrosion/condensation risks and appropriately asks for missing sizing inputs, but it makes a critical catalog error by claiming GDMI cannot be supplied in syrafast stainless (SF) and by mis-stating GDMI’s corrosion class. It also blocks the requested GDMI-SF without offering the correct catalog-compliant alternative (e.g., RF/SF material execution) or a different housing family if needed.*

Strengths: Appropriate safety/engineering warnings for offshore/marine exposure and condensation risk.; Correctly asks for missing sizing inputs before issuing product cards.
Weaknesses: Critical catalog mismatch: claims GDMI cannot be supplied in SF despite SF being a listed material option in the catalog material section.; Mischaracterizes corrosion class (states GDMI is C4 as a housing class rather than tying corrosion class to selected material/execution) and over-blocks the user request.
