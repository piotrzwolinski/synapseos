This is because the bolted construction of the GDB housing does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments.High Humidity can also accelerate corrosion of the galvanized steel.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation and have a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene requirements.
