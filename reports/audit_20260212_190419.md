*The system correctly identified the product family and the need to clarify housing length, which is a valid parameter for GDB. However, after receiving the valid length (550mm), it failed to return any product cards, despite the GDB 600x600 (550mm length) being a standard catalog item capable of handling the requested 2500 m³/h airflow (max 3400 m³/h).*

Strengths: Correctly identified the need to clarify housing length for the GDB family
Weaknesses: Failed to retrieve a standard, valid product from the inventory; Provided no explanation or fallback for the empty result
