The largest systemic modeling gap is that housing length values shown in the PDF as dual numbers (e.g., 550/600) are connection-dependent (PG vs flange), but the graph stores them as combined strings without an explicit rule; this can lead to incorrect physical length recommendations and code generation.\n\nThe most critical discrepancies are: (1) polisfilter/pre-mounted filter rail option PF is incorrectly tied to 1100/1150 in GDC and GDC FLEX (it belongs to 900/950 per the PDF), (2) code-format mismatches for EXL and Filter Profil (space vs hyphen), and (3) at least one suspicious GDB weight row is being used as data despite being flagged as a probable PDF error. Additionally, several families list broad material availability in the graph where the PDF only shows a standard material (or icons) plus a generic “on request” note; these should be represented as standard-vs-custom to avoid overstating selectable options."

The overall data quality is good, with most numeric values (airflows, weights, cartridge counts, dimensions) matching the PDF source exactly across hundreds of data points.\n\nThe most significant issues found are: (1) Incorrect polisfilter option lengths for GDC and GDC FLEX families - both incorrectly reference 1100/1150mm instead of the correct 900/950mm from the PDF; (2) A potential module breakdown error for GDB 600x900 where ¼ and ½ module counts may be swapped; (3) The GDC FLEX size '600x300' has a width/height interpretation ambiguity when compared to the PDF table's Bredd/Höjd columns; and (4) A contradictory statement about GDP default frame depth (50mm vs 25mm). The graph appropriately flags known PDF inconsistencies such as the GDMI length discrepancy between text and tables, and the suspicious GDB 1800x900 weight value.\n\nThe graph includes valuable supplementary data (chlorine PPM limits, environmental stressors, application mappings, dependency rules) that go beyond the PDF catalog scope. These Layer 2 enrichments are properly sourced as external references. Material availability per family is correctly modeled, including the important exclusion of stainless steel (RF/SF) from GDMI and GDMI FLEX families. The overall score of 72 reflects a solid foundation with a handful of critical corrections needed before production use."

I retract my earlier strict claims that EXL and Filter Profil must be hyphen-separated; the PDF examples print a space before the material (\"EXL-600 AZ\", \"Filter profil-600 FZ\"), so enforcing hyphenation would reduce fidelity unless the graph separates display vs normalized codes. Material availability for PT/TT should be modeled as standard=FZ with 'custom on request' rather than enumerating non-FZ materials unless explicitly listed; and any 'Ej i rostfritt' text should be encoded as explicit RF/SF exclusions to prevent leakage through generic rules."

The GDMI length source conflict between text (550/600, 800/850) and tables (600/650, 850/900) is appropriately handled by following the table values. Material availability is mostly correct but needs careful verification for GDMI (should be AZ and ZM only, not FZ), and the GDMI FLEX weight table has a PDF labeling error with duplicate column headers. The GDC FLEX dimension table has a likely Bredd/Höjd column swap compared to all other products. Code format issues raised by the OpenAI evaluator regarding EXL and Filter Profil are incorrect - the graph's space-separated format actually matches the PDF examples. Product-specific features like hinge types, lock types, and door insulation distinctions are likely missing from the graph. Overall, the graph captures the majority of catalog data correctly but has approximately 5-7 critical errors that need correction, primarily around polisfilter option lengths, material availability for GDMI, and dimension table interpretation for GDC FLEX."

      "MAJOR: Encode PG vs flange connection-dependent length rules across all cabinet families (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) — base length for PG, +50mm for flange.",
      "MAJOR: Add per-length-variant max filter depth constraints for GDB and GDMI to enable configurator validation.",
      "MAJOR: Add explicit RF/SF material exclusion constraints for GDMI and GDMI FLEX families (encode 'Ej i rostfritt' as hard rule).",
      "MAJOR: Verify and correct GDMI material availability — PDF shows only AZ and ZM icons, not FZ.",
      "MAJOR: Resolve GDP frame depth default contradiction (50mm vs 25mm).",
      "MAJOR: Correct GDB 600x900 module breakdown from ¼=0/½=1/1/1=1 to ¼=1/½=0/1/1=1.",
      "MAJOR: Add hinge type and lock type as differentiated product family attributes.",
      "MINOR: Annotate GDMI FLEX weight table column header as SUSPECTED_PDF_ERROR (both columns labeled 1100/1150).",
      "MINOR: Separate external engineering data (chlorine PPM) from PDF-sourced data with clear provenance metadata."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph captures all 12 product families from the MANN+HUMMEL HVAC filter cabinet catalog with generally accurate numeric data across hundreds of dimension, weight, airflow, and cartridge count data points. Systematic verification of GDB (27 sizes), GDP (35 sizes), GDMI (35 sizes), GDC (12 sizes), GDC FLEX (6 sizes), GDMI FLEX (8 sizes), PFF (25 sizes), and BFF (5 sizes) confirms that the vast majority of tabular data has been correctly transcribed.\n\nThe most critical defects are the incorrect polisfilter option lengths for GDC and GDC FLEX (both erroneously set to 1100/1150mm instead of the correct 900/950mm — a length that belongs to GDMI FLEX), and the GDC FLEX dimension table Bredd/Höjd column swap which appears to be a PDF error requiring annotation. The largest systemic modeling gap is that housing lengths shown as dual values (e.g., 550/600) are connection-dependent (PG vs flange +50mm) but stored as combined strings without explicit mapping rules, which can lead to incorrect physical length recommendations.\n\nAdditional issues include: a contradictory GDP frame depth default, a suspected GDB weight error at 1800x900, missing max filter depth constraints per length variant, incomplete material exclusion rules for GDMI/GDMI FLEX (RF/SF should be hard-excluded per 'Ej i rostfritt'), and supplementary engineering data (chlorine PPM) that lacks PDF provenance. The graph appropriately flags known PDF inconsistencies such as the GDMI length text-vs-table conflict. With approximately 5-7 critical/major corrections applied, the graph would be suitable for production use in a product configurator context."
