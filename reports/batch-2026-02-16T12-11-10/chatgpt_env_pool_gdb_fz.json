The housing corrosion class is C2. Persistent humidity accelerates zinc corrosion, reducing service life. More critically, the zinc coating (C3) dissolves in chlorinated environments within months. A minimum of C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) is required.To address this, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp. This unit provides C5 corrosion resistance and captures chlorine upstream, preventing it from reaching the target stage.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDB family. This unit provides the primary filtration function, now protected from chlorine exposure.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?What is the required airflow capacity (m³/h)?",
