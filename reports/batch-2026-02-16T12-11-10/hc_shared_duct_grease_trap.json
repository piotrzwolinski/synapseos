However, this application exposes the system to Grease/Oil Exposure. Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption, which will deactivate the carbon. To prevent this, a mechanical pre-filter stage is mandatory.Therefore, I recommend a two-stage filtration system:**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Kitchen/grease environments need mechanical pre-filtration before any carbon stage to protect carbon from lipid contamination. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Even trace grease permanently deactivates carbon. A pre-filter stage is mandatory for any application where grease, oil, or fat is present in the airstream. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
