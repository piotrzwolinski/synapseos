      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC FLEX is unsuitable due to several factors. The system is exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure, requiring both mechanical filtration and activated carbon adsorption, respectively. The GDC FLEX, designed for carbon adsorption, lacks the necessary mechanical filtration for particulate capture. Additionally, Outdoor Condensation can occur on non-insulated metal surfaces, and the single-wall construction of the GDC FLEX does not provide adequate thermal insulation to prevent condensation. Finally, the C2 housing corrosion class does not meet the VDI 6022 recommendation of C5 for Hygiene Requirements in medical/cleanroom applications.This configuration is therefore BLOCKED. The GDC FLEX's single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for a pharmaceutical environment. It is only approved for indoor and ATEX environments.The recommended alternative is a two-stage filtration system using a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target filter. This setup provides both mechanical filtration and carbon adsorption, addressing the particulate and chemical vapor exposure concerns. Both stages will use the 600x600mm housing size.The GDMI Modulfilterskåp is not available in RF (Stainless Steel). Would you prefer AZ (Aluzink) or ZM (ZinkMagnesium)?To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
