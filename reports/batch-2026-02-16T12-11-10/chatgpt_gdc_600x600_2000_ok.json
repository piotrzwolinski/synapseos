The interaction also omits key application clarifications for carbon filtration (media type, required removal efficiency, and prefiltration/police filter needs).",

            "correctness": "PDF shows GDC 600x600 has recommended airflow 2000 m³/h and weight 40 kg at 900/950 length, but the card states housing corrosion class C2 while the PDF material table lists FZ as Z275 with corrosivity class C3; engineering reasoning was minimal but not wrong.",
            "completeness": "It asked for the missing length (good) but did not confirm connection type (PG vs flange), door handing, carbon media/cylinder length, or whether a downstream police filter is required.",
            "safety": "No unsafe advice given for an indoor warehouse, but it missed standard carbon-system risk checks (dust carryover/police filter, contaminant type, and breakthrough monitoring).",
            "tone": "Professional and appropriately concise for a technical sales interaction.",
            "reasoning_quality": "Logic was straightforward (collect missing length → output matching SKU) but lacked transparency on why 900 mm was selected vs 750/800 and what assumptions were made.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Respects the W×H convention and selects an existing GDC size/length, but misstates corrosion class and provides duplicate product cards, which undermines adherence to clean output expectations."
