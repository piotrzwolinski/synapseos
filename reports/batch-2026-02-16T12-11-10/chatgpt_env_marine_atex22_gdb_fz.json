GDB housings have a C2 corrosion class and are not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray. Marine environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.Additionally, the single-wall uninsulated construction of the GDB housing is prone to condensation in outdoor environments. Outdoor Condensation and High Humidity can cause significant issues. A double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface temperature above the dew point, preventing condensation.To address these environmental stressors and the Explosive Atmosphere, I recommend a multi-stage filtration system. This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage and a GDMI Modulfilterskåp as the target stage. The GDMI is suitable for marine environments.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
