Please note that while the RF stainless steel provides excellent corrosion resistance (C5) suitable for indoor use, the housing itself is corrosion class C2.The GDC family is designed for particulate filtration, but is not suitable for chemical vapor or formaldehyde removal. Formaldehyde (HCHO) has very low molecular weight (30 g/mol) and is poorly adsorbed by standard activated carbon. Impregnated or chemisorption media (KOH, amine, or phosphoric acid treated) is required for effective removal. Standard carbon cartridges are insufficient.To finalize the configuration, I need to know the housing length.",
