The single-wall uninsulated construction of the GDC housing (corrosion class C2) does not provide adequate protection against these stressors, as it can lead to condensation and accelerated corrosion.Therefore, the configuration is BLOCKED. I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. To proceed with the GDMI configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?Also,What is the typical relative humidity at the site?Additionally, the requested 2600 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 2000 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 3000 m³/h.",
