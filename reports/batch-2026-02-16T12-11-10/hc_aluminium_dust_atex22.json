All metallic housing components must be grounded, and anti-static filter media should be used.The housing has a corrosion class of C2.**Note**: Explosive atmosphere (ATEX zone) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: (1) Grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components to prevent static discharge; (2) Anti-static filter media with conductive fibers or grounding strips — standard filter media is NOT suitable for ATEX zones; (3) Equipotential bonding between all housing sections; (4) Compliance with EN 60079-0 (general requirements) and EN 60079-31 (dust ignition protection).
