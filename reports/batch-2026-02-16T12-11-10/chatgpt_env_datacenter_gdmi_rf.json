Both provide excellent corrosion resistance, with AZ rated for C4 environments and ZM for C5.Given the outdoor installation, the system is exposed to high humidity, which accelerates zinc corrosion. The housing corrosion class is C4. Also, outdoor installation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.
