Please select an available material to proceed.The GDMI family is designed to provide Corrosion Resistance C3. However, given the coastal industrial facility application, the system is exposed to salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials are not suitable for marine environments.To address this, I am designing a two-stage filtration system. The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp, which provides Corrosion Resistance C5.1 and captures salt spray upstream, protecting the GDMI filter in the second stage. Both stages will use the 600x600mm duct dimensions you provided.I also need to gather some additional information to finalize the configuration. The outdoor installation exposes the system to outdoor condensation and high humidity. To ensure proper performance and prevent condensation on the housing, I need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site.Finally, for both the GDP Planfilterskåp (Stage 1) and the GDMI filter (Stage 2), I need to know the housing length. Which housing length do you need for each?",

The system is designed for an airflow of 3400 m³/h and duct dimensions of 600x600mm.The first stage, a GDP Planfilterskåp, provides corrosion resistance C5.1 and captures salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI filter. Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion, so this protection is critical. The second stage is the GDMI filter itself, which provides corrosion resistance C3. Outdoor installations also cause condensation when the surface temperature drops below the dew point. The GDP housing provides thermal insulation to prevent this. High humidity can also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing service life.The housing corrosion class is C4.**Note**: Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless). Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments.
