Please select an available material to proceed.For the marine chemical plant application, we've designed a two-stage filtration system to provide the required corrosion resistance and protect against environmental stressors.The system will address concerns related to outdoor condensation, high humidity, and salt spray. Salt spray can accelerate corrosion of C3-rated materials, and marine/coastal environments typically require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. High humidity can also accelerate zinc corrosion, potentially reducing the service life of components.Stage 1 will be a GDP Planfilterskåp, and Stage 2 will be a GDMI filter. The GDP unit will capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI filter. The GDMI filter provides the primary filtration, protected by the upstream GDP stage. Both stages will use 600x600mm dimensions and accommodate an airflow of 3400 m³/h.I need two more details to finalize the configuration:First, what is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?Second, what is the typical relative humidity at the site?",

The system is exposed to salt spray and high humidity, which accelerate corrosion. Additionally, outdoor installation can cause outdoor condensation on non-insulated surfaces.To address these challenges, the system uses a two-stage filtration process. The first stage uses a GDP Planfilterskåp to capture salt spray upstream, protecting the GDMI filter in the second stage. The GDMI filter provides Corrosion Resistance C3.Here are the specifications for each stage:**Note**: Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless). Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Salt spray accelerates zinc corrosion. C3-rated materials fail prematurely in marine/coastal environments. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Outdoor installations cause condensation when surface temperature drops below the dew point. Insulated (double-wall) housing maintains surface temperature above dew point, preventing water damage to filters. Non-negotiable — follow engineering recommendation",
