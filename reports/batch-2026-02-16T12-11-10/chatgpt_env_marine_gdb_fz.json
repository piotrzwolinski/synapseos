The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and single-wall uninsulated construction, which does not meet the leakage and hygiene requirements for marine environments with high humidity and salt spray. Salt spray accelerates corrosion on the C3-rated galvanized steel (FZ) and outdoor installation causes condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. To properly configure the two-stage filtration system with a GDP protector and a GDMI filter, I need to know the airflow and filter depth for the GDMI filter.Also, what are the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site?",
