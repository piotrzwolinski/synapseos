In explosive environments, any build-up of static charge on ungrounded filter housings can create sparks, which exceeds the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. To ensure safety, all components must be grounded to prevent ignition sources.Additionally, the powder coating process introduces Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure. Standard mechanical filters are ineffective at removing chemical vapors, and carbon filters are quickly blocked by particulates.Given these constraints, a multi-stage filtration system is required. I recommend a GDC FLEX carbon filter unit as the target stage, preceded by a bag filter to remove particulate matter and protect the carbon filter. To proceed with the configuration, I need two details:What is the required airflow (m³/h)?",
