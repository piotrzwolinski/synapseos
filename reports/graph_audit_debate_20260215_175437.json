The GDP family is the only one with accurate weight data. The GDB, GDC, and GDMI families have significant weight discrepancies, with GDB data appearing corrupted for larger sizes. Furthermore, the graph lacks cartridge count definitions for the majority of sizes in the GDC and Flex families, which is a critical omission for a filter catalog. Material definitions are mostly correct, though the inclusion of FZ for the insulated GDMI range contradicts the PDF's emphasis on ZM/C4 class."

Finally, at least one catalog item listed in the contents (PTT) is missing from the graph, and some option/compatibility logic (polisfilter rail and cylinder-length combinations) is not represented, risking wrong configuration suggestions."

The GDB family has systematically incorrect weights for nearly all sizes - the graph appears to store values that don't match either the 550/600 or 750/800 weight columns from the PDF. Many values appear to be roughly half the correct PDF values, suggesting a possible data import error. The GDMI family also has numerous weight discrepancies of 1-7 kg across many sizes. GDC and GDMI FLEX weights also contain multiple errors.\n\nThe graph is missing several GDMI sizes that exist in the PDF (particularly the larger 2400-series sizes and some 1800x2400, 2100x2400 combinations), while also containing sizes (1200x2100, 1500x2100) that don't appear in the PDF. Length variants across all families are stored as single values (e.g., '550mm') rather than the dual PG/Flange format shown in the PDF (e.g., '550/600mm'). Cartridge count CapacityRules are incomplete - only 2 sizes per family are stored when the PDF provides counts for all sizes.\n\nThe product family structure is largely correct with all 12 families present. Material availability is accurate for the main housing families (GDP, GDB, GDC, GDC FLEX) but missing for accessories (BFF, PFF, PT, EXL). The overall score of 52 reflects that while the graph's structure and product lineup are sound, the pervasive weight data errors and missing size/cartridge data would lead to incorrect product recommendations and specifications in a production system."

All evaluators agree that the graph's single-weight-per-size model is inadequate given the PDF's dual-weight structure (short/long housing). The cartridge count gaps for GDC and Flex families identified by the Gemini evaluator are confirmed as critical omissions. On material availability, I challenge the OpenAI evaluator's findings that restrict materials to FZ-only for GDP, GDB, GDC, and GDC FLEX - the PDF clearly shows material icons (FZ, AZ, RF, SF, ZM) on each of these product pages, indicating all five materials are available with FZ as default. I also challenge OpenAI's suggestion to add RF for GDMI, as the PDF explicitly states 'Ei i Rostfritt' (Not in Stainless). The length variant representation (storing only nominal values like 550 instead of paired 550/600) is a valid structural concern raised by OpenAI. Overall, the graph captures the product family structure and basic dimensions reasonably well but fails on precise attribute data - weights are wrong for most GDB/GDC/GDMI sizes, cartridge counts are incomplete, and the dual-length/dual-weight data model is not properly represented. The consensus score remains around 52, reflecting that while the skeleton is correct, the detailed data that engineers and specifiers would rely on is unreliable."

      "PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL: Re-import ALL GDB weights from PDF page 9. The current values are systematically wrong (often ~50% of correct values) for nearly all sizes. This is the single largest data quality issue.",
      "PRIORITY 2 - CRITICAL: Expand the graph schema to support dual weight values per size (short housing and long housing) for all multi-length families: GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX.",
      "PRIORITY 3 - CRITICAL: Add complete cartridge count data for all GDC sizes (12 sizes), GDC FLEX sizes (6 sizes), and GDMI FLEX sizes (8 sizes) from PDF pages 14, 16, and 18 respectively.",
      "PRIORITY 4 - CRITICAL: Model paired length variants (e.g., 550/600 instead of just 550) for all multi-length families, with explicit mapping between nominal ordering code length and physical PG/flange dimensions.",
      "PRIORITY 5 - CRITICAL: Reconcile GDMI size list against all 39 rows in PDF page 12. Add missing 2100-series and 2400-series sizes. Remove any phantom sizes not in the PDF.",
      "PRIORITY 6 - MAJOR: Correct individual GDMI, GDC, and GDMI FLEX weight values against their respective PDF tables (pages 12, 14, 18).",
      "PRIORITY 7 - MAJOR: Model polisfilter rail option and cylinder-length compatibility rules for GDC and GDC FLEX families.",
      "PRIORITY 8 - MAJOR: Add pull-out carbon filter plate (utdragbar kolfilterplatta) as an explicit feature for GDC FLEX and GDMI FLEX.",
      "PRIORITY 9 - MAJOR: Add filter module counts (¼, ½, 1/1) per size for GDB and GDMI families from their respective tables.",
      "PRIORITY 10 - MINOR: Add material availability for accessories (BFF, PFF, PT, EXL) based on the material icons shown on their respective PDF pages."

    "summary": "The knowledge graph has significant and pervasive data quality issues that would render it unreliable for production use in product configuration, specification, or ordering. The most severe problem is in weight data: GDB weights are systematically wrong for nearly all sizes (often approximately half the correct PDF values), suggesting a fundamental data import error. GDMI, GDC, and GDMI FLEX weights also contain numerous individual mismatches of 1-16 kg. Compounding this, the graph's single-weight-per-size schema cannot represent the PDF's dual-weight structure (one weight per housing length variant), meaning even correctly imported values would only capture half the required data.\n\nBeyond weights, cartridge counts for carbon filter cabinets (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) are critically incomplete—only 2 of 12/6/8 sizes have counts stored despite the PDF providing complete data. Length variants across all multi-length families are oversimplified (storing single nominal values like '550' instead of the paired PG/flange values '550/600' shown in the PDF). The GDMI family is also missing multiple sizes from the 2100 and 2400 series that exist in the PDF.\n\nThe graph's structural framework—product family hierarchy, basic dimensions, and airflow ratings—is largely sound. Material availability is mostly correct, with the important caveat that GDMI and GDMI FLEX correctly exclude stainless steel (RF/SF) per the PDF's explicit 'Ej i Rostfritt' statement. However, the quantitative attribute data that engineers and specifiers would rely on for actual product selection and ordering is unreliable across the majority of product families. The consensus overall score of 48 reflects a graph that has the right skeleton but critically flawed flesh."
