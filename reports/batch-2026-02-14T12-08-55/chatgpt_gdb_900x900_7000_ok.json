          "explanation": "The system correctly identified the GDB 900x900 product and its airflow capacity of 7650 m³/h, which matches the PDF. However, the weight is incorrect — the PDF shows 53 kg for the 900x900 at 750/800 length but the system also duplicated the product card unnecessarily, reducing quality. The housing length convention (750 vs 750/800) is slightly imprecise but acceptable.",

            "correctness": "PDF confirms GDB 900x900 Flöde=7650 m³/h (p.9), matching the system's claim; however, the weight listed in the PDF for 750/800 is 53 kg which the system shows as '~53.0 kg' — this is correct, but the duplicate product card is a quality issue. The corrosion class C2 for FZ GDB is confirmed by the PDF.",
            "completeness": "The system provided the core recommendation with key specs but duplicated the product card, did not mention filter module configuration (1×¼ + 2×½ + 1×1/1 modules per PDF), and did not discuss connection type options or door hinge alternatives in detail.",
            "safety": "The system correctly noted 'Indoor only: Yes' which aligns with the PDF stating GDB is 'För inomhusbruk', and the airflow capacity of 7650 m³/h exceeds the requested 7000 m³/h, which is safe.",
            "tone": "Professional and consultative tone throughout; appropriate for a technical sales context with clear product card formatting.",
            "reasoning_quality": "The system appropriately asked for housing length before finalizing, showing good process flow, but did not explain why 7650 m³/h capacity is suitable for 7000 m³/h request or discuss any margin considerations.",
            "constraint_adherence": "The system correctly selected GDB with FZ material and 750mm length, all of which are valid per the PDF catalog; no constraint violations detected."
