      "content": "For your offshore platform application, we need to address the environmental stressors. The selected GDB housing with FZ (Galvanized) material is not suitable for marine environments due to the presence of Salt Spray and High Humidity, which accelerate corrosion. Additionally, Outdoor Condensation can form on the housing's surface.The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and is designed for indoor-only applications. Because of the marine environment, this configuration is BLOCKED. The bolted construction of the GDB housing does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for marine environments (ENV_MARINE) and have a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To provide a complete engineering solution, we recommend a multi-stage assembly. This assembly includes a protector stage (GDP) to pre-filter the air and protect the target stage (GDB) from the harsh marine environment. Both stages will share the same dimensions of 600x600mm and handle an airflow of 3,400 m³/h.To finalize the configuration for the second stage, I need to know the filter depth for the GDB housing.",
