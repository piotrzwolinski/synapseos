      "content": "For the cruise ship exhaust application, you requested a GDC housing with RF (stainless steel) material.However, this configuration is blocked. The GDC housing is not suitable for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine (ENV_MARINE) installations. The housing corrosion class is C2, which is also insufficient for the detected stressors.Specifically, the system is exposed to Outdoor Condensation, which can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. High Humidity, which reduces carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerates zinc corrosion, and Salt Spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless).Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_MARINE installation and use a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. Additionally, the requested airflow of 2600 m³/h exceeds the maximum capacity of 2000 m³/h for a single 600x600 module, requiring either parallel units or a larger module size.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To provide a complete engineering solution, I am including a multi-stage assembly with a GDP protector stage to provide upstream filtration. Note that this configuration still does not meet the environmental requirements for ENV_MARINE.The system requires parallel units to handle the 2600 m³/h airflow. The arrangement will use 2 units with effective housing dimensions of 1200x600mm.To finalize the configuration, I need the filter depth for the GDC stage.",
