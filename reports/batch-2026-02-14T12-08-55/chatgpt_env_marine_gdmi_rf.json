Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for your offshore project is blocked. The GDMI family is unsuitable for marine environments due to the presence of salt spray, which accelerates corrosion of the C3-rated materials. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.Additionally, outdoor installation introduces the risk of outdoor condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces, and persistent high humidity further accelerates corrosion. A double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and double-wall insulation. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
