      "content": "For the rooftop exhaust application, the GDB filter housing is not suitable for outdoor installation due to the risk of Outdoor Condensation. The bolted construction of the GDB housing does not meet the leakage and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments, potentially leading to water damage and reduced filter performance. Additionally, High Humidity can reduce the carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerate corrosion of the C2-rated housing.Therefore, the GDB housing is blocked for this project. No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation (ENV_OUTDOOR) and use a construction type that meets the necessary leakage class and hygiene requirements. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.We can explore the GDMI FLEX series, which is designed for more demanding environments. To proceed with a GDMI FLEX configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
