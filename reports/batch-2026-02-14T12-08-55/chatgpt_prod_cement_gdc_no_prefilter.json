However, in flour milling and grain processing, the system is exposed to Particulate Exposure. Activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. To protect the carbon filters from the fine cement dust in the exhaust, we need to add a mechanical pre-filtration stage.I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp will capture the particulate.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC family will provide the required Porous Adsorption.Both stages will use the same 900x600mm duct dimensions and handle the 2400 m³/h airflow.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:Which ATEX zone classification applies (Zone 0/1/2 for gas, Zone 20/21/22 for dust)?",
