Housings in this environment must maintain a high level of air tightness to prevent contaminants from entering the sterile wards.I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp as an alternative. It is approved for hospital environments and meets the necessary hygiene standards.The hospital application also exposes the system to Hygiene Requirements. Medical/cleanroom applications follow VDI 6022 which recommends C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) for hygienic surfaces.
