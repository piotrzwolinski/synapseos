Outdoor installations with Outdoor Condensation require double-wall insulated housings to prevent condensation on the metal surfaces. Additionally, persistent High Humidity can accelerate zinc corrosion. The GDMI housing is C4 rated, which helps mitigate this, but the bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements for outdoor installation. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
