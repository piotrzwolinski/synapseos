      "content": "This GDB filter housing configuration for your offshore application in an ATEX Zone 22 area is currently blocked. The selected GDB housing with C2 corrosion class is not suitable for the marine environment due to the presence of Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray, which will accelerate corrosion. Additionally, the Explosive Atmosphere requires specific grounding and anti-static measures.Specifically, the GDB family's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. Standard GDB housings are not insulated, leading to condensation issues in outdoor settings. Furthermore, the C2-rated materials will corrode rapidly due to salt spray. For ATEX Zone 22, all components must be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all these requirements simultaneously. A suitable solution would need to have C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance, double-wall insulation to prevent condensation, and full ATEX compliance.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements for a tailored solution.",

The selected GDB housing with C2 corrosion class is not suitable for the marine environment due to the presence of Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray, which will accelerate corrosion. Additionally, the Explosive Atmosphere requires specific grounding and anti-static measures."

Standard GDB housings are not insulated, leading to condensation issues in outdoor settings. Furthermore, the C2-rated materials will corrode rapidly due to salt spray. For ATEX Zone 22, all components must be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition."
