Please select an available material to proceed.For the marine chemical plant application, we are designing a two-stage filtration system to protect the GDMI housing from environmental stressors.The GDMI housing is C4-rated, but the marine environment introduces **Salt Spray**, which accelerates corrosion. Additionally, **High Humidity** can reduce the service life of the housing. **Outdoor Condensation** can also form on non-insulated metal surfaces.Unfortunately, the GDMI family is NOT rated for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements. Therefore, this configuration is BLOCKED. No standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for marine environments and use a construction method that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with the configuration of the GDP protector stage, I need the filter depth for the 600x600 filter. Also, what are the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site?",

A solution would need to be rated for marine environments and use a construction method that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements."
