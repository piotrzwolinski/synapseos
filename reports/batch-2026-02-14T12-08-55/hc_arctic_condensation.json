Installing a non-insulated housing outdoors will lead to condensation, potentially causing corrosion and reduced filter performance. Additionally, the High Humidity will accelerate corrosion of the C2-rated housing.The GDB family uses a bolted construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. Therefore, this configuration is BLOCKED.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation and use a welded construction to meet leakage and hygiene requirements.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
