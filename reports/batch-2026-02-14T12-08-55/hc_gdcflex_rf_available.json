      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC-FLEX filter housing is not suitable due to several environmental factors. The system is exposed to Particulate Exposure and Chemical Vapor Exposure from the cleanroom environment, Outdoor Condensation due to the rooftop location, and Hygiene Requirements specific to pharmaceutical applications.The GDC-FLEX is blocked for pharmaceutical environments because its rail-mounted construction does not meet the required leakage class and hygiene standards. It is only rated for indoor and ATEX environments.Additionally, the GDC-FLEX housing has a C2 corrosion class, which is insufficient for rooftop installations. The C2 rating offers limited protection against corrosion, which is inadequate for the environmental conditions on a rooftop.To meet these requirements, we recommend a two-stage filtration system using the GDMI Modulfilterskåp. This setup includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage to remove particulate matter, followed by the GDMI Modulfilterskåp for gas and odor removal. This combination ensures both particulate and chemical vapor removal while providing thermal insulation to prevent condensation.The GDMI Modulfilterskåp is approved for pharmaceutical environments and provides the necessary thermal insulation for outdoor installations. The housing corrosion class is C2.For the GDMI stage, stainless steel (RF) is unavailable. The recommended alternative is Aluzink (AZ) or ZinkMagnesium (ZM), which offer high corrosion resistance (C4 and C5 respectively).To proceed, I need to know the minimum expected ambient temperature and typical relative humidity at the installation site to finalize the configuration.",
