Please select an available material to proceed.This filter housing is intended for a ship installation and requires stainless steel construction.The application exposes the system to salt spray, outdoor condensation, and high humidity. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of C3-rated materials, and marine environments require C5.1-rated stainless steel. Outdoor installation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces.Unfortunately, the GDMI family is not rated for marine environments due to its bolted construction, which does not meet leakage and hygiene requirements. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be constructed without bolts to meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a custom solution, I need two details:What are the filter dimensions for the GDP protector stage?",
