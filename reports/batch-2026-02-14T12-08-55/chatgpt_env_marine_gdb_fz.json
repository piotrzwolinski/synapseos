      "content": "For the offshore platform project, I understand you're looking at a GDB housing with 600x600mm dimensions.Unfortunately, the GDB family is not suitable for marine environments due to the risk of corrosion from salt spray and condensation from outdoor installation. The housing's C2 corrosion class and bolted construction do not meet the requirements for marine environments.Specifically, salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C3-rated galvanized steel, and outdoor condensation can form on the housing's non-insulated metal surfaces. High humidity will further accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing the service life of the housing.Therefore, the GDB housing is blocked for this application. It uses bolted construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and double-wall insulation. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
