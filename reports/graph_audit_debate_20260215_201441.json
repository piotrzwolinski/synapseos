All 12 product families from the PDF are represented, and the vast majority of dimensional data, weights, airflow ratings, and cartridge counts are accurately captured. The graph correctly models the material availability for each family, including the important restriction that GDMI and GDMI FLEX are not available in stainless steel (RF/SF).\n\nThe most significant issues found are: (1) A potential data error in the GDB 1800x900 short weight (36 kg in both PDF and graph, but physically implausible given that 1800x600 weighs 47 kg), (2) Some filter module breakdown discrepancies for GDB sizes where ¼ and ½ module counts appear swapped (e.g., 600x900 and 1200x900), and (3) The GDMI default material question (graph says ZM default, but PDF example code shows AZ). The GDC FLEX dimension table in the PDF has a notable width/height swap that should be documented.\n\nMinor gaps include missing metadata for hinge types, door insulation details, maximum filter classes (F9), and the aluminum framework construction detail for GDMI/GDMI FLEX. The PFF construction type is marked as 'BOLTED (PENDING_MIKAEL)' which needs resolution. Overall, the graph is approximately 72% complete and accurate, with the core product data being reliable but some edge cases and metadata enrichment opportunities remaining."

Several accessory-material findings from other evaluators should be reframed: PT/TT/Filter Profil list FZ as standard while other materials are only 'på begäran', so the graph should not treat these as missing standard materials unless it supports a 'special order' availability attribute. The strongest correction from peer review is that my own finding about GDMI needing stainless material availability is not supported cleanly by this catalog; the GDMI section appears internally inconsistent and should be flagged rather than asserted. My original critical issue about GDMI FLEX incorrectly allowing AZ remains: the GDMI FLEX page shows only FZ and ZM and the example code uses FZ. Overall, the graph appears broadly accurate on core dimensional/selection data but needs better modeling for (a) standard vs on-request material availability and (b) resolving/annotating catalog inconsistencies (default material and corrosion-class semantics)."

    "summary": "The MANN+HUMMEL HVAC filter housing knowledge graph demonstrates strong accuracy in its core dimensional data, including sizes, weights, airflow ratings, and cartridge counts across all 12 product families (GDP, GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX, BFF, PFF, PT, TT, EXL, Filter Profil). The vast majority of numeric table data has been faithfully transcribed from the PDF catalog, and the graph correctly covers all listed size variants including the extended GDMI range up to 2400x2400. The graph appropriately follows dimension table values over descriptive text where the PDF contains internal inconsistencies (e.g., GDMI lengths).\n\nThe most significant issues are structural/metadata in nature rather than numeric errors. The corrosion class data model creates contradictions by storing both product-level ratings (C2 for FZ-based cabinets) and material-level ratings (C3 for FZ sheet) without a clear hierarchy. The GDMI default material has a genuine PDF inconsistency between text (ZM) and example code (AZ) that needs product team resolution. The PFF construction type and GDMI FLEX service access type contain incorrect metadata values. One suspected PDF source error exists in the GDB 1800x900 short weight (36 kg, physically implausible). Material availability for accessory products (TT, Filter Profil) is incomplete, missing on-request options shown by page icons.\n\nOverall, the graph is reliable for product selection and configuration purposes, with the core engineering data being accurate. The recommended corrections focus on metadata modeling improvements (corrosion class hierarchy, construction details, material availability flags) rather than fundamental data errors. With the identified corrections applied, the graph would achieve a high level of catalog fidelity suitable for production use."
