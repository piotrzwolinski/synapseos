    "PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL DATA RE-INGESTION: Re-ingest all dimension/weight/airflow tables from the PDF for GDP (page 6), GDC (page 14), GDC FLEX (page 16), GDMI (page 12), GDMI FLEX (page 18), and PFF (page 21). Each family has its own unique table that must NOT be copied from GDB. This single action addresses ~20 CRITICAL findings.",
    "PRIORITY 2 - ADD MISSING PRODUCT FAMILIES: Create nodes for BFF (page 20), PT (page 22), TT (page 22), EXL (page 23), and Filter Profil (page 23) with all sizes, attributes, and code formats from their respective PDF sections.",
    "PRIORITY 3 - ADD MISSING SIZES: Add 21 missing GDP sizes (page 6), 11 missing GDMI sizes including all 2100x and 2400x variants (page 12), and 2 missing GDC sizes (page 14).",
    "PRIORITY 4 - COMPLETE CARTRIDGE COUNTS: Add CapacityRule nodes for all GDC sizes (10 missing), all GDC FLEX sizes (4 missing), and all GDMI FLEX sizes (6 missing) from their respective PDF tables.",
    "PRIORITY 5 - FIX REFERENCE LENGTHS: Correct GDP from 550→250mm, GDC from 550→750/800mm, GDC FLEX from 550→750/800mm, GDMI from 550→600/650mm, GDMI FLEX from 550→850/900mm, PFF from 550→25/50/100mm (depth, not length).",
    "PRIORITY 6 - ADD DUAL WEIGHT COLUMNS: Store both short and long length-variant weights for GDB (550/600 vs 750/800), GDC (750/800 vs 900/950), GDC FLEX (750/800 vs 900/950), GDMI (600/650 vs 850/900), and GDMI FLEX (850/900 vs 1100/1150).",
    "PRIORITY 7 - FIX CONSTRUCTION METADATA: Change GDC FLEX and GDMI FLEX from RAIL_MOUNTED to correct construction types. Set GDMI Outdoor safe = False.",
    "PRIORITY 8 - ADD FILTER MODULE DATA: Add PFF frame counts and exact dimensions for all GDP sizes, and filter module breakdowns (1/4, 1/2, 1/1) for all GDB and GDMI sizes.",
    "PRIORITY 9 - COMPLETE OPTIONS: Add missing Fläns ohålad (F) option to GDC, GDMI. Add polisfilter options to GDC FLEX and GDMI FLEX. Add frame depth options (25/50/100) to GDP.",
    "PRIORITY 10 - IMPLEMENT DATA PROVENANCE: Tag each data field with its source PDF page and table to prevent future cross-family data contamination."

  "summary": "The knowledge graph suffers from a catastrophic systemic data ingestion error: the GDB (Kanalfilterskåp / Duct Filter Cabinet) dimension table was incorrectly propagated to nearly all other product families — GDP, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI, GDMI FLEX, and PFF. This means every airflow value, weight value, and reference length for these six families is wrong. GDP airflows are overstated by 40-70% (e.g., 600x600 shows 3400 m³/h instead of the correct 2000 m³/h). GDP weights are approximately double what they should be (e.g., 600x600 shows 27 kg instead of 12 kg). GDP's reference length is 550mm instead of the correct 250mm. Carbon/cartridge families (GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) show modular-cabinet airflows instead of their recommended flows, which are roughly half the displayed values. PFF, which is a flat filter frame with depth options of 25/50/100mm, is incorrectly modeled as a housing with GDB-style dimensions.\n\nBeyond the data accuracy crisis, the graph is missing five complete product families that are defined in the catalog: BFF (Påsfilterram), PT (Plan Övergång), TT (Konisk Övergång), EXL (Excenterlåsning), and Filter Profil. The graph is also missing 21 of 35 GDP sizes, 11 of 39 GDMI sizes (the entire 2100x and 2400x series), and 2 of 12 GDC sizes. Cartridge counts are missing for the majority of GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX sizes. Construction type metadata for FLEX families is incorrect (labeled RAIL_MOUNTED without PDF support), and GDMI is contradictorily marked as both indoor-only and outdoor-safe.\n\nAll three independent evaluators converged on the same fundamental diagnosis with high confidence. The consensus score of 18/100 reflects that while the graph's structural framework and GDB-specific data are largely correct, the pervasive cross-family data contamination and missing products render the graph unreliable for engineering specifications, product selection, or commercial use. Immediate remediation requires re-ingesting each family's specific PDF table and adding all missing product families and sizes."
