Outdoor installations require thermally insulated housings to prevent condensation on the metal surfaces.Additionally, the high humidity environment can reduce the carbon adsorption efficiency and accelerate corrosion. The housing corrosion class is C2.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. The GDB family uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor installation and use a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
