Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for your offshore project is blocked. GDMI housings are not suitable for marine environments due to the presence of Salt Spray, High Humidity, and Outdoor Condensation. The bolted construction of the GDMI housing does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments, which require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance (acid-proof stainless).No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To meet your needs, a solution would require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a construction that meets the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
