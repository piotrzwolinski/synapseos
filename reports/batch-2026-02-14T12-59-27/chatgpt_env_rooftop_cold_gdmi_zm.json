The system has detected both High Humidity and Outdoor Condensation as environmental stressors.Outdoor installations with high humidity expose the system to condensation. Condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces can cause corrosion and reduce the lifespan of components. Additionally, persistent humidity accelerates zinc corrosion, potentially reducing the service life of the housing.The GDMI housing is not rated for outdoor installation because its bolted construction does not meet the required leakage class and hygiene standards for outdoor environments. The housing corrosion class is C4.Unfortunately, there is no standard catalog product that meets all the requirements for outdoor installation. To address this, I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with your specific technical requirements.",
