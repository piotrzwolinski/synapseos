The only valid housing lengths are 550mm and 750mm.This is because the housing length is determined by the filter depth. The 900mm housing is designed for filters with a depth greater than 450mm, but this length is not a standard option for the 600x600 housing size.Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies all your requirements simultaneously.
