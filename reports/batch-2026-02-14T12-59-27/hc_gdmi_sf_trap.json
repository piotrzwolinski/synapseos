Please select an available material to proceed.This GDMI housing configuration for a marine chemical plant is blocked due to environmental incompatibility. The marine environment exposes the system to Salt Spray and High Humidity, which require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. GDMI housings are bolted construction and not rated for marine environments.Additionally, Outdoor Condensation is a concern for outdoor installations. This requires a double-wall insulated housing to maintain the surface above the dew point.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 corrosion resistance and a fully-welded housing construction to prevent leakage. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.For reference, here is the multi-stage assembly that would have been recommended if the product was not blocked:",
