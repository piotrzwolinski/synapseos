Additionally, the housing corrosion class is C2, and the FZ (C3 galvanized) material is not suitable for environments with H2S, as it corrodes rapidly. To ensure proper protection, a housing with a welded construction and a minimum C5 corrosion class is required.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all these requirements simultaneously. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
