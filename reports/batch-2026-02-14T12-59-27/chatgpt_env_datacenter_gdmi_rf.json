Please select an available material to proceed.For the outdoor data center intake application, you've selected a GDMI housing with 600x600mm dimensions.I must inform you that the GDMI housing is not rated for outdoor installation due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the required leakage class and hygiene standards. This configuration is therefore blocked.Additionally, the outdoor environment introduces stressors such as High Humidity and Outdoor Condensation. High Humidity can accelerate zinc corrosion, potentially reducing the service life of the housing. Outdoor Condensation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. A double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To proceed, you would need a housing specifically designed and rated for outdoor use, featuring a welded construction to ensure proper sealing and hygiene. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
