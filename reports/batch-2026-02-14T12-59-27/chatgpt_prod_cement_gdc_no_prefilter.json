To protect the carbon filters from the fine cement dust in the exhaust, we need to add a mechanical pre-filtration stage.I recommend a two-stage filtration system:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp will capture the particulate.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC family will provide the required Porous Adsorption.Both stages will use the same 900x600mm duct dimensions and handle the 2400 m³/h airflow.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:Which ATEX zone classification applies (Zone 0/1/2 for gas, Zone 20/21/22 for dust)?",
