However, the GDC family is not suitable for environments with particulate exposure.Particulate Exposure, such as cement dust, can quickly clog the activated carbon pores in GDC filters, rendering them ineffective for gas adsorption. To address this, a two-stage filtration system is required:Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp - This pre-filter stage provides mechanical filtration to capture the cement dust before it reaches the carbon filter.Stage 2 (TARGET): GDC family - This stage provides the required Porous Adsorption.To properly configure this two-stage system, I need a few more details:Which ATEX zone classification applies (Zone 0/1/2 for gas, Zone 20/21/22 for dust)?",
