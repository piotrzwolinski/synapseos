The system is exposed to High Humidity and Outdoor Condensation.Outdoor Condensation can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. High Humidity accelerates zinc corrosion, reducing service life.Unfortunately, this configuration is blocked. The GDMI family is not rated for outdoor installation due to its bolted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments. A solution would need to be rated for outdoor use with a construction type that ensures adequate sealing and hygiene.Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies these requirements. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a suitable recommendation, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",

However, the block is overly conservative — GDMI is insulated and double-walled with C4-rated ZM material, which is reasonable for many outdoor applications.

            "reasoning_quality": "The reasoning about humidity and condensation is sound, but the specific claim about 'bolted construction not meeting leakage class and hygiene requirements for outdoor environments' is a logical jump — the real issue is simply that GDMI is catalog-rated for indoor use only, not a specific construction-type failure mode.",
            "constraint_adherence": "The system correctly notes GDMI is for indoor use per the PDF, but the block may be overly rigid — in practice, GDMI's insulated double-wall construction with ZM (C5) material could potentially serve sheltered rooftop applications with appropriate weatherproofing, and the system should at least discuss this rather than hard-blocking."
