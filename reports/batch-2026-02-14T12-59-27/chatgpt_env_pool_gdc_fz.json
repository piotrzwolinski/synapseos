The C3 zinc coating will dissolve rapidly in this environment, leading to corrosion.Additionally, the GDC housing is not rated for ENV_POOL installation, as its bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment. Therefore, this configuration is blocked.To proceed, a solution would need to use a material with higher chlorine resistance (minimum C5) and be specifically rated for pool environments, with a construction type that meets the necessary leakage and hygiene standards. Currently, no standard catalog product satisfies these requirements simultaneously.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements. In the meantime, could you please provide the approximate chlorine concentration in the environment (ppm)?",
