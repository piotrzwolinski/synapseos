      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC-FLEX filter housing is not suitable. This is due to several factors: The system will be exposed to Particulate Exposure, Chemical Vapor Exposure, Outdoor Condensation, and Hygiene Requirements. The GDC-FLEX housing has a C2 corrosion class and rail-mounted construction, which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for pharmaceutical environments. Additionally, its carbon adsorption is ineffective against solid particulates, and it lacks the double-wall insulation needed to prevent condensation in outdoor settings. Therefore, this configuration is blocked. Instead, I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for pharmaceutical environments. To provide a complete solution, this requires a two-stage assembly: Stage 1 (PROTECTOR): GDP Planfilterskåp provides upstream mechanical filtration to protect the second stage from particulate exposure. Stage 2 (TARGET): GDMI Modulfilterskåp provides the necessary activated carbon adsorption to remove gas-phase contaminants. To finalize the configuration, I need two details: What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
