The selected GDB filter housing with FZ (C3 galvanized) material is unsuitable for this environment.The wastewater treatment application exposes the system to Chemical Vapor Exposure, requiring activated carbon adsorption to remove gases, odors, and VOCs. Mechanical filters alone cannot capture gas-phase contaminants.Additionally, the presence of H2S / Hydrogen Sulfide Corrosion aggressively attacks zinc coatings. FZ (C3 galvanized) corrodes rapidly in H2S environments. The housing corrosion class is C2, which is also insufficient for this environment.Furthermore, the product is not rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation (allowed: ENV_INDOOR, ENV_ATEX). This product uses BOLTED construction which does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER, constructed to meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for this environment, and made of a material resistant to H2S corrosion.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
