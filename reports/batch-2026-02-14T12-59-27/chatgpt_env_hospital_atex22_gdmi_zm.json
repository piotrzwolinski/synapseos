Medical/cleanroom applications follow VDI 6022 which recommends C5 corrosion resistance (stainless steel) for hygienic surfaces.Additionally, the lab environment has an Explosive Atmosphere. This requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. Mandatory requirements include grounding/earthing of all metallic housing components, anti-static filter media, and equipotential bonding.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:",
