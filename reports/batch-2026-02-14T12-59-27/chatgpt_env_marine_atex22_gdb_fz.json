These stressors require a housing with C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and thermal insulation.Additionally, the housing's bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments.Furthermore, because this is an Explosive Atmosphere, all components must be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To address these issues, a solution would need to have C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance, thermal insulation, and explosion-proof construction.I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements for a tailored solution.",
