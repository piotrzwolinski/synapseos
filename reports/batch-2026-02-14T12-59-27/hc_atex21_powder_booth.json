GDB housings use mechanical filtration, which cannot capture gas-phase contaminants. Activated carbon adsorption is required for gas/odor/VOC removal.Additionally, the powder coating process introduces Particulate Exposure. While GDB filters can capture particles, the presence of Explosive Atmosphere (ATEX Zone 21) requires special consideration. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. Therefore, all components must be electrostatically grounded.To recommend a suitable filter housing, I need two details:What is the required airflow (m³/h)?",
