Please select an available material to proceed.This configuration for your ship installation is currently blocked. The GDMI family housings, while having a C3 corrosion resistance rating, are not suitable for marine environments due to the presence of salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion. Marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance.Additionally, outdoor installations expose the system to outdoor condensation and high humidity, which can cause condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces and accelerate zinc corrosion, respectively. A double-wall insulated housing is required to maintain the surface above the dew point.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance and a double-wall insulated housing. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To proceed with a custom solution, I need two details for both stages of the assembly:What are the filter dimensions (width x height) and the required airflow?",
