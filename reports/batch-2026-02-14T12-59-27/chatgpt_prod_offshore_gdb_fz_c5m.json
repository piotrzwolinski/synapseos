Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the galvanized (FZ) material. Outdoor installation causes condensation on the housing. The GDB family is therefore vetoed.The product is blocked because its bolted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine environments. No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. To proceed, you would need a solution rated for marine environments with a welded construction. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To finalize the configuration of the GDP protector stage, I need to know the filter depth.",
