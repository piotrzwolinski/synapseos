      "content": "For the rooftop kitchen exhaust at the hospital, the requested GDC-FLEX housing is blocked due to installation and capacity constraints. The GDC-FLEX is not rated for marine environments and its rail-mounted construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for marine installation. Additionally, the requested airflow of 3000 m³/h exceeds the maximum capacity of 1750 m³/h for a single 600x600 module. The system is also exposed to High Humidity, Chemical Vapor Exposure, Outdoor Condensation, Grease/Oil Exposure, Salt Spray, and Hygiene Requirements. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of the C2-rated housing, while marine/coastal environments require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. Outdoor condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces necessitates a double-wall insulated housing. High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Grease/Oil Exposure will cause lipids to permanently coat activated carbon pores, deactivating the carbon. A pre-filter stage is mandatory for any application where grease, oil, or fat is present in the airstream. Gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption.Unfortunately, no standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for marine environments, provide double-wall insulation, and include a grease separator. I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.To address the Grease/Oil Exposure and provide carbon filtration, a two-stage assembly is required:",

Outdoor condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces necessitates a double-wall insulated housing. High humidity reduces carbon adsorption efficiency. Grease/Oil Exposure will cause lipids to permanently coat activated carbon pores, deactivating the carbon. A pre-filter stage is mandatory for any application where grease, oil, or fat is present in the airstream. Gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption."
