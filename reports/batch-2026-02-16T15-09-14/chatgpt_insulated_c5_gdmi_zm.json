Please select an available material to proceed.For your coastal industrial facility, we need to address the environmental stressors to ensure the filter system's longevity. The system will be exposed to Outdoor Condensation, High Humidity, and Salt Spray. Salt spray can accelerate corrosion of C3-rated materials, and outdoor condensation can cause moisture issues without proper insulation. High humidity can also reduce the service life of standard materials.Given these conditions, I recommend a two-stage filtration system. The first stage will be a GDP Planfilterskåp to capture salt spray, protecting the second stage GDMI filter. This is necessary because the GDMI filter provides C3 corrosion resistance, which is insufficient for marine environments without additional protection. The GDP filter provides C5.1 corrosion resistance, offering the required protection.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",

However, given the marine/offshore application, the system is exposed to salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion, potentially leading to premature failure of C3-rated materials. Additionally, the outdoor/rooftop installation introduces the risk of outdoor condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. High humidity can also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing service life. To address these environmental stressors, I recommend a two-stage filtration system.This system includes a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage to capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI filter. The GDMI filter provides the primary Corrosion Resistance C3 function, now protected by the upstream stage. Both stages will use the specified 600x600mm duct dimensions and handle an airflow of 3400 m³/h.To finalize the configuration:",

However, given the marine/offshore application, the system is exposed to salt spray, which accelerates zinc corrosion, potentially leading to premature failure of C3-rated materials. Additionally, the outdoor/rooftop installation introduces the risk of outdoor condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces. High humidity can also accelerate zinc corrosion, reducing service life. To address these environmental stressors, I recommend a two-stage filtration system."
