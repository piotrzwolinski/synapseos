However, it then made a critical sizing error by claiming two parallel 600x600 units are required (and implying each would still see 4000 m³/h), and it also provided an incorrect weight for GDMI 600x600/600-650.",

            "constraint_adherence": "Violates catalog constraints by using a non-catalog length designation ('600mm' instead of 600/650) and misapplies the airflow constraint by mandating two units when one larger module is a valid catalog option."
