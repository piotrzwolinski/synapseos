            "safety": "No safety warnings given (e.g., potential carbon dust and recommendation for downstream particle filter/polisfilter in sensitive applications), but no unsafe configuration was recommended for an indoor warehouse.",

            "reasoning_quality": "Clear sizing logic (airflow + size + length selection) but lacks intermediate engineering checks beyond picking the matching catalog row.",
