However, the system detects both Chemical Vapor Exposure and Formaldehyde Exposure.Gas/odor/VOC removal requires activated carbon adsorption. Mechanical filters cannot capture gas-phase contaminants.Formaldehyde (HCHO) has very low molecular weight (30 g/mol) and is poorly adsorbed by standard activated carbon. Impregnated or chemisorption media (KOH, amine, or phosphoric acid treated) is required for effective removal. Standard carbon cartridges are insufficient.Therefore, the GDC filter housing with standard carbon cartridges is not suitable for formaldehyde removal.

However, it incorrectly blocks the GDC concept outright and asks for housing length even though the user already specified a GDC-600x600 and the catalog defines the available lengths; it also fails to validate that 2000 m³/h matches the GDC-600x600 recommended flow.",

            "completeness": "It does not confirm airflow-to-size fit, does not propose the correct GDC length option (750/800 vs 900/950) or police filter choice, and does not address RF availability/lead time vs standard materials.",
