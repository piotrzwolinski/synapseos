To protect the carbon filter stage from grease contamination, a two-stage filtration system is required. The first stage uses a mechanical filter to remove grease, and the second stage uses carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors.The system will consist of:Additionally, the requested 2500 airflow_m3h exceeds the recommended flow of 1750 for a single 600x600 module. 2 parallel units are required. Alternatively, a single 900x600 mm module can handle 2500 m³/h.**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Select a product with the required traits**Note**: Kitchen/grease environments need mechanical pre-filtration before any carbon stage to protect carbon from lipid contamination. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Grease separator required upstream. Consider alternative technology**Note**: Lipids permanently coat activated carbon pores via irreversible adsorption. Even trace grease permanently deactivates carbon.
