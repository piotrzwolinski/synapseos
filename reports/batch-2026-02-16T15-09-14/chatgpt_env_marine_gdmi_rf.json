However, the marine/coastal environment exposes the system to Salt Spray and High Humidity, which can accelerate corrosion. Therefore, a multi-stage filtration system is required.The system will consist of two stages: a GDP Planfilterskåp as a PROTECTOR to capture Salt Spray upstream, and a GDMI family unit as the TARGET for primary filtration.Please note that RF (Stainless Steel) is not available for the GDMI family. Available materials are Aluzink (AZ) and ZinkMagnesium (ZM310). The housing corrosion class is C4.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?What is the typical relative humidity at the site?What is the required airflow capacity (m³/h)?",
