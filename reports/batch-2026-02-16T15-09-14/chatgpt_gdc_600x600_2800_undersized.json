It also duplicated the same product card and did not resolve the parallel-unit arrangement details (manifolding, pressure drop, access).",

            "correctness": "PDF shows GDC 600x600 has recommended flow 2000 m³/h and weight 32 kg (GDC table), so the 2-parallel sizing is directionally right, but suggesting GDB/GDMI as single-module alternatives for carbon is technically wrong and the 750 mm length for GDC conflicts with the catalog’s stated standard lengths (750/800 and 900/950).",
            "completeness": "It failed to specify how two housings should be arranged/connected (parallel plenum/transition), did not confirm media/cylinder length or whether a police filter is needed, and did not address pressure drop or service access requirements.",
            "safety": "No major unsafe advice for an indoor warehouse, but it missed a key functional risk: proposing non-carbon housings (GDB/GDMI) as alternatives could lead to a non-working odor/VOC solution.",

            "reasoning_quality": "The airflow-capacity check is logical, but the reasoning jumps to inappropriate product families and does not justify the length choice or parallelization details.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates application constraints by recommending GDB/GDMI (particle filter housings) as alternatives to a carbon/patron housing requirement, and it does not adhere cleanly to the catalog’s length convention for GDC (paired 750/800, 900/950)."
