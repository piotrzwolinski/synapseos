            "completeness": "Misses explicit material in the final code/specs, connection type (PG vs flange), door handing, and whether 750 means 750/800 per catalog; also repeats the product card.",
            "safety": "No major unsafe advice given, but it fails to flag the mismatch between requested stainless (C5) and delivered C2 housing, which can become a corrosion/IAQ risk depending on environment and cleaning chemicals.",

            "reasoning_quality": "Reasoning is not consistent end-to-end: it states RF/C5 initially but outputs a C2 housing without explanation or reconciliation.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Violates the user constraint (RF stainless) and likely the catalog convention where lengths are listed as 750/800 rather than a single 750, without clarifying which variant is being supplied."
