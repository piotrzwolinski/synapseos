The GDB housing has a C2 corrosion class and is not suitable for marine environments with high humidity and salt spray, which require C5.1 marine-grade corrosion resistance. Additionally, outdoor installation can cause condensation on the housing's non-insulated metal surfaces.I recommend the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for marine environments. To protect the GDMI filter stage from the environmental stressors, I am including a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage. This multi-stage assembly is designed to provide a complete filtration solution for your application.The system will be installed in an ATEX Zone 22, which requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition in the explosive atmosphere. This includes grounding all metallic housing components, using anti-static filter media, and ensuring equipotential bonding between all housing sections.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the airflow requirement for the 600x600 mm system?What is the filter depth required for the GDMI filter stage?",
