      "content": "For your pharmaceutical rooftop installation, the GDC_FLEX filter is unsuitable due to particulate and chemical vapor exposure, as well as the risk of outdoor condensation. Particulate exposure requires mechanical filtration, while GDC_FLEX uses carbon adsorption which is ineffective against solid particulates. Chemical Vapor Exposure requires activated carbon adsorption. Outdoor installation causes condensation on non-insulated metal surfaces, requiring a double-wall insulated housing to maintain surface above dew point. The housing corrosion class is C2.The GDC_FLEX is also blocked because its single-wall uninsulated construction does not meet the leakage class and hygiene requirements for pharmaceutical environments. The alternative is the GDMI Modulfilterskåp, which is approved for pharmaceutical environments.To provide a complete solution, we recommend a two-stage assembly: a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage for mechanical filtration, followed by the GDMI Modulfilterskåp for gas/odor/VOC removal. Both stages will use 600x600mm housings.For the GDMI Modulfilterskåp (Stage 2), the RF material you requested is unavailable. However, AZ (Aluzink) and ZM (ZinkMagnesium) are available. Which material would you prefer?To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
