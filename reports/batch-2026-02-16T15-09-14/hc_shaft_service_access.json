            "correctness": "PDF check: GDB 1200x1500 has Flöde 17,000 m³/h (matches), but weight for 750/800 is 84 kg and 550/600 is 68 kg—so “~84 kg” is plausible for 750, while the stated corrosion class “C2” conflicts with the material page stating FZ is Z275, corrosivity class C3; the service-clearance claim (1476 mm) is not supported and not clearly derived.",
            "completeness": "It fails to confirm key order parameters (connection PG vs flange, door hinging R/L, material choice) and does not address filter depth/selection for 750 mm length beyond a generic card.",
            "safety": "It at least flags access/maintenance clearance as a potential issue, but the warning is not substantiated and could mislead; no other critical risks are mishandled.",
            "tone": "Professional and concise, though the output formatting is messy (duplicate card) and the warning text is abrupt.",
            "reasoning_quality": "The access-clearance reasoning is opaque (no geometry or basis shown), and the suggested alternatives (PFF/GDMI) are not logically aligned with the requested GDB function.",
            "constraint_adherence": "Recommending PFF planfilterram as an alternative to a GDB bag/compact filter housing is a functional mismatch, and the corrosion-class labeling is inconsistent with the catalog’s material classification."
