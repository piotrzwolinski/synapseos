The housing has a corrosion class of C2.The FZ (C3 galvanized) material is not resistant to H2S, which aggressively attacks zinc coatings, leading to rapid corrosion. Additionally, the GDB filter is a mechanical filter, which cannot capture gas-phase contaminants like chemical vapors. This configuration is therefore BLOCKED. No standard catalog product satisfies all requirements simultaneously. A solution would need to be rated for ENV_WASTEWATER installation and use a material with a higher corrosion resistance (minimum C5) to withstand H2S, as well as incorporate activated carbon adsorption to remove chemical vapors. Since no standard catalog product currently satisfies all requirements simultaneously, I recommend contacting our Custom Engineering or Technical Support team with these specific technical requirements.",
