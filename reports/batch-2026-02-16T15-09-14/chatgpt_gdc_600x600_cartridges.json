            "completeness": "It never answered “How many cartridges does it hold?” and omitted key selection details (e.g., cartridge count, option for 900/950 with police filter) while also duplicating the product card.",

            "reasoning_quality": "The clarification step (asking for length) was logical, but the final response had weak follow-through by not using the length to answer the cartridge-capacity question.",
