            "correctness": "PDF shows GDC FLEX 900x600 has recommended airflow 2500 m³/h and weight 40 kg (750/800 length), but the system did not state/encode the requested FZ material in the final card and gave an inconsistent corrosion class label (C2) without tying it to the selected material; engineering reasoning (need length) is sound.",
            "completeness": "It omitted key ordered attributes in the final configuration (material/connection/handing) and provided no confirmation of length variant (750 vs 750/800) beyond a simplified '750mm'.",
            "safety": "No unsafe advice was given for an indoor carbon housing, but it also provided no standard carbon-specific notes (e.g., need for downstream polish filter if koldamm is critical) that the catalog highlights as an option.",

            "reasoning_quality": "The clarification step (requesting housing length) was logical, but the final output did not reflect the user’s stated constraints (FZ), reducing transparency and traceability.",
            "constraint_adherence": "User constraint 'FZ material' was not carried into the final product card, and the system output duplicated the same product card twice, indicating poor adherence to configuration/output rules."
