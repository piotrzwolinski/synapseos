All metallic housing components must be grounded, and anti-static filter media should be used.The housing has a corrosion class of C2.**Note**: Explosive atmosphere (ATEX zone) requires all components to be electrostatically grounded to prevent spark ignition. Consider products with this trait**Note**: Explosive atmospheres require all components to prevent ignition sources. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures.
