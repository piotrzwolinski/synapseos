Salt spray can cause C3-rated materials to fail prematurely. Additionally, Outdoor Condensation can occur on non-insulated metal surfaces.To address this, the system will use a GDP Planfilterskåp as a protector stage to capture salt spray upstream, preventing it from reaching the GDMI unit. This ensures the GDMI's C3 rating is sufficient for your needs. The housing corrosion class is C4.Please note that while you requested Syrafast Stainless Steel (SF / 316), this material is not available for the GDMI product family. Available materials include Aluzink and Zinkmagnesium ZM310.To finalize the configuration, I need two details:What is the minimum expected ambient temperature at the installation site?",
