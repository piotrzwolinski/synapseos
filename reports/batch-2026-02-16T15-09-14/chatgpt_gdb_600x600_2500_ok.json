          "explanation": "The system correctly asked for the missing housing length and then selected a valid GDB 600x600 in 550 mm length with plausible airflow capacity and weight per the catalog. However, it duplicated the product card and did not address any application/environment context (indoor-only limitation, corrosion class selection rationale), which reduces completeness.",

            "completeness": "It confirmed size/material/airflow and requested length, but omitted connection type choice (PG vs flange), door handing confirmation, and any application/environment checks (GDB is stated for indoor use).",
            "safety": "No unsafe claims were made, but it missed a standard warning that GDB is intended for indoor use and that FZ/C2 may be unsuitable for harsher environments.",
            "tone": "Professional and concise, appropriate for technical sales support.",
            "reasoning_quality": "Clear sizing logic (requested 2500 vs rated 3400) and appropriate clarification for length, but little explanation of why 550 mm vs 750 mm might be preferred (filter depth/selection).",
            "constraint_adherence": "Respects catalog constraints (GDB family, 600x600 size, 550 length option, FZ material) and does not propose non-catalog configurations."
