The GDB uses mechanical filtration, which is ineffective for gas/odor/VOC removal. For chemical vapors, activated carbon adsorption is required.Additionally, the powder coating line creates an Explosive Atmosphere. Static charge on ungrounded filter housings can produce sparks exceeding the minimum ignition energy of many dust/gas mixtures. For ATEX Zone 21, all components must be grounded to prevent ignition sources.The GDC filter housing is also unsuitable because it uses carbon adsorption, which is ineffective for solid particulates. In environments with Particulate Exposure, activated carbon pores get physically blocked by particles, rendering gas adsorption useless. Pre-filtration is mandatory.To properly address both particulate and chemical vapor exposure, a multi-stage filtration system is required. This will consist of a mechanical pre-filter stage for particulate capture, followed by a carbon filter stage for vapor adsorption.To configure the correct solution, I need two details:",
