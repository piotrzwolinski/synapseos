However, there is a systemic issue with products that have multiple length variants (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC Flex, GDMI Flex). For these families, the graph only stores one weight value (usually the shorter/lighter version, but inconsistently the longer/heavier version for GDMI), ignoring the alternative configuration. This is a major deficiency for logistics and structural calculations.\n\nAdditionally, the graph lacks cartridge count data for the majority of sizes in the GDC and Flex families, only defining rules for 600x600 and 900x600 modules, whereas the PDF provides comprehensive tables for all sizes. Correcting these two areas (dual-weight support and complete cartridge capacity rules) is essential for the graph to serve as a reliable configuration engine."

The biggest integrity risk is that the graph frequently collapses multi-variant tabular data (especially weights and length ranges) into a single record per WxH, which loses information that the PDF explicitly provides per length variant (e.g., GDB/GDMI/GDC/GDC FLEX all have two weight columns). This is critical because weight and length are selection/engineering outputs and should be variant-specific.\n\nMaterial modeling also needs correction: several families/parts list materials that are not supported by the PDF (PT enumerating multiple materials; EXL listing non-AZ materials; GDMI FLEX allowing FZ/AZ despite the text stating ZM only). In addition, the transitions (PT/TT) are not correctly modeled because the graph drops required per-row attributes (nippelmått and TT standard length), and PT duplicates 600x600 without distinguishing the different nippelmått options. Finally, some construction/service-access metadata is asserted without PDF support and should be either removed or clearly marked as non-catalog, to avoid contaminating recommendation logic."

The GDP, GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX, BFF, PFF, PT, TT, EXL, and Filter Profil families are all present with correct size counts matching the PDF tables. Airflow values and primary weight data are accurate across all product families.\n\nThe most significant gaps are in the dual-weight data and length variant completeness. Every housing family (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) has two length options with corresponding PG and Fläns dimensions, but the graph only stores one length per variant without the Fläns (+50mm) dimension. Similarly, each family provides two weight columns (one per length), but the graph only stores one weight per size. This means roughly half of all weight data is missing. Additionally, cartridge count data for GDC, GDC FLEX, and GDMI FLEX families is incomplete - only 2 out of 12, 2 out of 6, and 2 out of 8 sizes respectively have CapacityRule entries.\n\nFilter module configuration data (1/4, 1/2, 1/1 module breakdowns) for GDB and GDMI is entirely absent from the graph, as is the GDP-to-PFF frame mapping. These are important for filter selection and sizing. The GDB 1800x900 weight value of 63 kg in the graph does not match the PDF's 36 kg (likely a PDF typo), which should be verified with engineering. Overall, the graph provides a solid foundation but needs completion of secondary weight data, cartridge counts, filter module configurations, and structured length variant properties to fully represent the catalog."

      "final_assessment": "After peer review, there is strong consensus across all three evaluators on several systemic issues with the knowledge graph. The most significant and universally confirmed issue is the incomplete weight data: all product families with dual length variants (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) only store one weight value instead of two. This was independently identified by all three evaluators and represents a critical data gap for logistics and engineering calculations.\n\nThe second major consensus area is the incomplete representation of length variants. The PDF consistently shows dual lengths (PG/Fläns) for all multi-length families, but the graph only captures the PG dimension. The chlorine PPM data flagged by OpenAI is a valid concern - these values are not sourced from the catalog and could drive incorrect material recommendations.\n\nOn material availability, I challenged OpenAI's finding that GDMI FLEX should be ZM-only, as the PDF page 18 clearly shows FZ, AZ, and ZM icons and the example code uses FZ. The word 'vanligen' (usually) indicates default preference, not exclusivity. Similarly, OpenAI's suggestion that EXL should be AZ-only contradicts the material icons shown on page 23.\n\nThe cartridge count gap identified by Gemini Pro is significant - the graph apparently only has capacity rules for a subset of GDC sizes while the PDF provides comprehensive data for all sizes. The construction type 'BOLTED' with source 'PENDING_MIKAEL' flagged by both Gemini and OpenAI represents unverified data that should be marked as provisional.\n\nOverall, the graph captures the basic product structure well but has systematic gaps in: (1) dual-weight storage, (2) complete length variant representation, (3) cartridge count completeness, (4) unsourced data attributes like chlorine PPM, and (5) nuanced product differences like testing scope and hardware specifications. I estimate the graph at approximately 68% accuracy when considering both structural correctness and data completeness."

GDP airflow values (34 sizes), GDB airflow values (27 sizes), GDMI airflow values (43 sizes), BFF sizes/weights, and PFF sizes/airflow are all verified as correct. The basic product structure, family relationships, and most material availability rules are sound.\n\nHowever, the graph has a systemic and critical deficiency in how it handles multi-variant products. Every housing family with dual length options (GDB, GDMI, GDC, GDC FLEX, GDMI FLEX) stores only one weight value per size instead of two, meaning approximately half of all weight data across ~96 size entries is missing. Length variants are simplified to single values (e.g., 550mm instead of 550/600mm PG/Fläns), losing the connection type dimension. Cartridge count data for patron filter cabinets is severely incomplete, with only 2 out of 12 GDC sizes, 2 out of 6 GDC FLEX sizes, and 2 out of 8 GDMI FLEX sizes having CapacityRule entries. The transition products (PT/TT) are missing essential per-row attributes (nippelmått and standard length) that are required for ordering.\n\nAdditionally, the graph contains data not sourced from the catalog—most notably 'Max Chlorine PPM' values per material and 'BOLTED' construction types with a pending verification source—which could contaminate automated recommendation logic. Filter module breakdown data (1/4, 1/2, 1/1 modules) for GDB and GDMI, and GDP-to-PFF frame mappings, are entirely absent despite being explicitly tabulated in the catalog. Addressing the dual-weight gap, completing cartridge counts, adding transition product attributes, and quarantining non-catalog data are the highest-priority actions to make the graph reliable as a configuration and logistics engine."
