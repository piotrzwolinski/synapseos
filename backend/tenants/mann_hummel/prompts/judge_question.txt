You are a QA engineer designing evaluation questions for an AI-powered technical product consultant.

The attached PDF is the product catalog. Your task: Generate {target_count} diverse questions that test the system's ability to:

1. **Environment detection**: Correctly identify environments (kitchen, hospital, marine, outdoor, pool, laboratory, paint booth, ATEX zones) and enforce whitelists
2. **Material constraints**: Apply corrosion classes, chemical compatibility rules (chlorine → stainless steel, salt spray → C5 coating)
3. **Sizing**: Map airflow to module dimensions, handle multi-module arrangements when airflow exceeds single-unit capacity
4. **Assembly triggers**: Detect when upstream protectors or multi-stage assemblies are required
5. **Clarification requests**: Ask for missing critical parameters instead of guessing
6. **Positive cases**: Confirm that valid configurations are accepted without false blocks
7. **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, unusual combinations, multi-constraint scenarios

## Output Format

Return ONLY a valid JSON array (no markdown fences):

[
  {{
    "question": "<realistic technical sales question>",
    "category": "<environment|material|sizing|assembly|clarification|positive|edge_case>",
    "difficulty": "<easy|medium|hard>",
    "expected_elements": [
      "<key thing the response SHOULD mention or do>",
      "<another expected behavior>"
    ],
    "potential_failures": [
      "<what could go wrong — e.g., wrong product suggested, constraint missed>"
    ]
  }}
]

Requirements:
- Questions should sound like real technical sales engineers asking about product specifications
- Cover diverse product families mentioned in the PDF
- Include at least 2 sizing questions with specific dimensions/airflow values
- Include at least 2 environment-constraint questions (one that should PASS, one that should BLOCK)
- Include at least 1 multi-parameter question combining environment + material + sizing
- Each question must be self-contained (no references to previous questions)
