## Evaluation Instructions

1. **Verify product data against the PDF**: Look up the product family, size, airflow capacity, material options, and weight in the attached catalog. Flag any discrepancies.
2. **Evaluate engineering reasoning with your HVAC expertise**: Assess whether environment assessments, material recommendations, safety warnings, and sizing logic are technically sound. The system applies engineering knowledge beyond the PDF — if the reasoning is correct, credit it.
3. **Score each dimension** using the right verification method: PDF for product specs, your expertise for engineering reasoning.

In your `dimension_explanations.correctness` field, cite at least one specific PDF data point you verified AND note whether the engineering reasoning is sound.
