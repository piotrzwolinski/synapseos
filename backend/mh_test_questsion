I need a quote for the Nouryon project. We have two tags:
Tag 5684: Nanoclass Deeppleat H13 - size 305x610x150 mm, SS frame, 25mm header.
Tag 7889: Nanoclass Deeppleat E11 - size 610x610x292 mm, SS frame, 25mm header.
Please recommend the correct GDB housings in Stainless Steel (RF) for both.
Also, for the 305x610 model, can you confirm which dimension is vertical?
Finally, what are the weights for the complete assemblies?

>

Here is the data for the Nouryon project tags:
Tag 5684: Airflow is 1700 m³/h. 
Tag 7889: Airflow is 3200 m³/h. 
Please provide the final product codes and total weights.

I am working on the AstraZeneca laboratory update. Can you help me with a quote for these two tags?
Tag L-01: Filter element size 610x305x150 mm, with 25mm frame.
Tag L-02: Filter element size 610x610x292 mm, with 25mm frame.
For both tags, we want the GDB housings but in Aluzinc (AZ) material.

I'm designing a ventilation exhaust for a commercial kitchen in a new hotel. We've decided to use a GDC carbon housing to eliminate cooking odors. The space is tight, so we must fit it to a 600x600mm duct, and we want the Stainless Steel (RF) version for durability. Can you give me the correct product code for this?

I need a quote for the Norsk Hydro storage facility. We require a GDB housing for a rooftop exhaust system. The design airflow is 10,000 m³/h. Due to the limited space on the mounting platform, the total width of the unit cannot exceed 1300 mm. Since this is a budget-sensitive project, we want to use the standard Galvanized (FZ) version without any insulation. Please provide the recommended size and the final product code.

I need a GDB-600x600 housing. We have a very tight vertical shaft that is exactly 650mm wide. The housing is 600mm wide, so it fits physically with 25mm of margin on each side. Is this a correct installation?

We want to upgrade our air quality to hospital standards. Can we install HEPA H13 Nanoclass filters into our existing GDB housings? We just need to change the internal frames, right?

>

Airflow is 3000 m³/h, and the filter depth is 635 mm. I confirmed that the 650mm shaft width is fixed and cannot be changed. Since GDB won't work for servicing, what is your alternative recommendation that fits this tight space?

The installation environment is a Hospital. Please select the most cost-effective material that is compliant with hygiene standards for this application. Once selected, provide the final configuration.

I am selecting a GDC-600x600 carbon unit for 2000 m³/h. My ventilation system uses round ducts (500mm diameter). Can I connect the GDC directly to these pipes? Provide the final product code.

I will use Galvanized Steel (FZ). Please provide the final product code for the GDC housing and also include the specific codes for the transition pieces needed for my Ø500mm round ducts.
